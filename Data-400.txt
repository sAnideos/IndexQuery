When it does, it teleports itself to a safe location so quickly that it creates the illusion of having made copies of itself. By hypnotizing itself, Abra is able to teleport or use any of its other extrasensory abilities at any time. Due to the strain of its telepathic powers, however, Abra sleeps 18 hours each day. If it fails to rest long enough, it will become unable to use its powers.

3 Absol (Japanese:  Absol) is a Dark-type Pokemon.While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon, it can Mega Evolve into Mega Absol using the Absolite.Absol is a quadruped, mammalian Pokemon with a dark blue to gray body covered in white fur. It has a ruff around its neck and chest and a tuft on the top of its head adorned with a single blue-black oval. It has a feline face with almond-shaped, red eyes, a scythe-like tail, and a sickle-shaped horn on the side of its head. Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs.As Mega Absol, its fur is longer overall, and the increased energy coursing through its body makes the fur at the back of its mane stand on end, so that it appears to have wings.[1] The spikes on its heels and elbows grow larger, and the fur in these areas becomes longer as well. Its sickle-shaped horn widens, while an additional, smaller horn appears on the opposite side of its head. Its tail now has a more saw-like shape, and the oval marking on its forehead is now a rounded triangle.Absol lives in the mountains far from civilization, and rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a natural disaster will occur, and will try to warn people when one is approaching. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster.Absol first appeared in Jirachi: Wish Maker. The Disaster Pokemon showed up to take Jirachi back to Forina. However, Absol wasn't evil, and helped Jirachi once it returned to Forina.The Disaster Pokemon made its first anime appearance in Absol-ute Disaster. The people of a town were blaming Absol for all the bad things that were happening to their town during the past month. Ash and friends (along with a boy named Nicky) went out to search whether or not the accusations were true. They found out that the Absol was actually warning the town about a flood.An Absol owned by Mollie appeared in What I Did for Love!

It first appears to Ruby, who shudders in fear immediately. Absol is also present in the feud between Kyogre and Groudon. Like in the anime, Absol is accused of bringing disaster.Absol is one of Koya's main Pokemon. It is used in his battles at the Pokemon League, and in subsequent battles against Team Galactic.One Absol figure has been released.Absol is most likely based on the Bai Ze () of Chinese mythology, whose name literally translates to "white marsh." It is generally described as a white beast, distinguished by having one or two horns on its head. Considered to be an intelligent beast, Bai Ze is gifted with the ability to understand human speech and the knowledge on the forms and habits of 11,520 types of supernatural creatures in the world. In legend, Bai Ze shared its knowledge to the Yellow Emperor, which was subsequently compiled in a book called Bai Ze Tu. Few of its supposed fragments survive today. In Japan, it is known as the hakutaku (). In a related legend, a similar creature known as the kutabe predicted that a plague would sweep through the Toyama Prefecture of Japan. It is also sometimes said to have an extra eye on their head or back, which may be represented by the oval that appears on Absol's forehead.Absol's head is modeled after a Taijitu symbol. Absol's humanized face and feline appearance may also be a homage to the sphinx. Its scythe-shaped tail and horn suggest a resemblance to the Western personified depiction of Death, who is related to destiny and disaster. It may have also been inspired by the black cat superstition.Absol may derive from  buss (dangerous). It may also be a combination of ab- ("away from") and sol (Latin for sun), referring to its Dark-type nature. The latter may also be a reference to a solar eclipse, as many cultures considered a solar eclipse as a sign of end-times or disaster. It may also be derived from absolute, relating to its ability to foretell impending disasters.

Green stripes run from its eyes to the top of its head, and there is a black star-like marking or hole on the front. Its eyes are hidden in a shadowed crevice in its head. The rest of its body is covered by a dull blue, cloth-like membrane, which keeps Accelgor from dehydrating, with ribbon-like extensions at the top of its back.

It lives in moist habitats like bogs and swamps.Accelgor debuted in The Mighty Accelguard to the Rescue! under the ownership of Charles.Bianca's Shelmet evolved into an Accelgor in Evolution Exchange Excitement!, after being traded with Professor Juniper for her Karrablast.Alder has an Accelgor which was used to battle Marshal at the Battle Subway.An Accelgor appears as the Burst form of Karuta. His father also has an Accelgor, which he can use as his Burst form.Accelgor appears to be based on an auto racer or a ninja, combined with a giant tube worm. Its cloth-like "clothing" and Bug type suggest it may also be based on the bagworm pupa.Accelgor may be a combination of accelerate and escargot (French for snail).Agilder may be a combination of agile and rider.
5 Aegislash (Japanese:  Gillguard) is a dual-type Steel Ghost Pokemon.It evolves from Doublade when exposed to a Dusk Stone. It is the final form of Honedge.Aegislash has the ability to change forms during battle, depending on the moves it is using.Aegislash's body is comprised of a golden sword with the blade pointing downwards. The edge of the blade is white and somewhat serrated near the tip. Its single eye, which is purple with a white, linear pupil, sits where the blade meets the hilt, where it is surrounded by black coloration. The handle is thick at its base, tapers as it progresses to the end, and is striated. Two cloth-like arms emerge from the sides of the hilt. Each arm is primarily black and ends in lavender, transitioned by a slight whorl between the two colors. It carries an ornate shield in at least one of its arms.Aegislash is capable of changing its stance in the middle of battle, depending on what moves it uses. It carries out offensive moves in its Blade Forme, in which it carries its shield in its left arm and exposes its blade, which it uses to slash its opponents. Defensive moves are performed in its Shield Forme, in which it holds its shield up in front of its blade, with both of its arms crossed behind the shield.It is said to be able to detect the innate qualities of leadership; legend has it that whoever Aegislash recognizes as a worthy leader is destined to become king. Indeed, this Pokemon has attended and served generations of kings. It is also known to use its spectral power to manipulate people and Pokemon alike.

Its disposition to sense an owner's potential as leaders and kings, seems to draw inspiration from the ideas of mythical swords of European legend, chiefly Excalibur.Aegislash is a combination of Aegis (Zeus' shield in Greek mythology) and slash.Gillguard may be a combination of Gilgamesh or gild (to cover with a layer of gold),  kiru (to slay with a blade) or kill, and guard.

Its head has two vicious eyes, pointed ears and a mouth full of serrated fangs. It has light violet-gray skin over much of its body, two pale violet membranes stretched between its arms and sides. Aerodactyl has plate-like spines going down its back, leading to its strong, triangular spade-tipped tail. Its talon-like feet are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey.When Aerodactyl Mega Evolves, its body begins to turn to stone, which, according to some researchers, was how it looked before it fossilized.[1] This Pokemon becomes paler and gains multiple black spikes all over its body. There are five spikes on each wing replacing its hands, three on its tail, one large spike on its back, and one on the back of each foot. Five additional spikes appear on its head: two replacing its pointed ears, two on the sides of its face and one on its chin. There are now two black plates above its eyes. It has three dark bumps on its chest: two small marks and a longer mark between the other two. Its eyes have changed to a dark green color.Due to the sharp appearance of Aerodactyl's fangs, it was originally thought to be a carnivore. However, the anime shows it joyfully consuming fruit. Still, its sharp fangs are very imposing, and are said to be used to rip out the throats of its enemies easily. With its impressive wings, Aerodactyl is well at home within the skies. It fearlessly soars high, letting out its high-pitched cries freely. When at rest it enjoys the safety and seclusion of the mountains where it likes to nest. Aerodactyl is extant using Fossil revitalization, but is considered extinct in the wild.Aerodactyl first appeared in Attack of the Prehistoric Pokemon. It scared off the other Generation I Fossil Pokemon that were chasing Ash and Team Rocket. It then kidnapped the young Trainer, who was rescued by his Charizard. Todd took a photo of this Aerodactyl, which was seen in Pokemon Paparazzi. The same Aerodactyl appeared in a flashback in Who Gets To Keep Togepi? and The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!.Fossils of Kabutops and Aerodactyl were resurrected by Annie and Oakley in Pokemon Heroes; in the English dub, they were once used by an evil Pokemon Trainer to torment the civilians of Alto Mare, but were drowned when a Latios brought water to the city. They were sent to chase after Ash and Latias. They have blank, yellow-tinted eyes with no pupils and are lined with a thick black outline.Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl featured an Aerodactyl that was revived by Gary Oak. The Aerodactyl seemed to enjoy eating a pear-like fruit that grew in the forests of an island. Team Rocket agents Butch and Cassidy wanted to steal this Aerodactyl in order to present it to Dr. Namba, but were stopped by Gary's Umbreon and Dodrio, and the Aerodactyl itself, who sent the two Rockets flying with a Hyper Beam.Another Aerodactyl appeared in Wild in the Streets, where it terrorized Oreburgh City after being revived from its Fossil state, until it was caught by Dr. Kenzo.Two Aerodactyl can be seen flying within the Tree of Beginning in Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.

He also owns multiple other Aerodactyl which were used in his Dragon-type army that were used to attack the mainlands of Kanto. They first appeared in Playing Horsea.Lance owns an Aerodactyl as seen in Space Havoc!!.It appears to be based upon pterosaurs, prehistoric flying reptiles, particularly the rhamphorhynchoidea branch, due to Aerodactyl's possession of teeth and a long tail. It also seems to possess some dragon-like characteristics, such as that of a wyvern, a two legged variety of dragon, which would explain its being on Lance's team.Aerodactyl is a combination of aero (Greek for air) and pterodactyl.Ptera derives from pterosaur.
7 Aggron (Japanese:  Bossgodora) is a dual-type Steel Rock Pokemon.It evolves from Lairon starting at level 42. It is the final form of Aron.

Its tail is thicker with two bands around it.The gouges in Aggron's armor from previous battles are worn as mementos. The more wounds it has, the more it has battled. It claims a large mountain as its territory and fiercely defends it from trespassers. If its environment is damaged by a flood or a forest fire, it will restore the area by bringing in topsoil and planting trees. It burrows through the strongest of bedrock and digs tunnels, as it searches for iron to eat. Its horns, which it uses to dig through bedrock when seeking food, grow a little longer at a time and can be used to determine its age.Aggron's first major appearance in A Hole Lotta Trouble, under the ownership of Steven Stone.

Its fur is purple, while the skin of its face, inner ears, belly, feet, and the tip of its tail is beige. On its face are a usually cheeky smile and round, blue eyes. Supplemented by its round ears, Aipom's head is disproportionately large compared to its body. Atop its head is a cowlick that is longer on females than males. Unlike its feet, Aipom's arms are simple, purple stubs.Aipom uses its powerful tail freely and cleverly for many purposes. The tail is strong enough to anchor Aipom to a branch and suspend the rest of its body in the air, but also delicate enough to pick fruit and manipulate objects. Aipom has been known to wrap its tail around tree branches as it sleeps so it does not fall. Since Aipom uses its tail so much, its actual arms are not as dexterous. Aipom lives high in the treetops, using its tail for balance as it swings from branch to branch.Multiple Aipom appeared in Slaking Kong, one of which stole Ash's hat. In Channeling the Battle Zone, Ash captured the aforementioned Aipom. Her behavior is similar to that of Ash's Chikorita: attention-seeking, very naughty at times, and occasionally jealous. However, she developed a close bond with Ash. In Throwing the Track Switch, Ash traded her to Dawn for Buizel because Aipom had a love of Contests and Buizel was more interested in Gym battles.

Because it was not very powerful, it was typically used in situations that needed its dexterity or for distracting opponents with Double Team. In the battle against the Masked Man, it showed its worth by having Sudobo inherit the speed boost of its Agility to restrain the villain. It was also very skilled with pulling fast ones or using Gold's equipment to send out multiple Pokemon at once, as displayed when it spun Gold's billiard cue around to power up Exbo's Blast Burn attack.In the HeartGold & SoulSilver chapter, it was revealed to have evolved into an Ambipom. Its evolution was later depicted by flashbacks.Aipom will not appear in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team until a rescue mission involving it has been completed, using the following Wonder Mail code:Aipom appears to be based on a monkey and the exaggerated concept of a prehensile tail. It may be specifically based on the squirrel monkey, which is similar in appearance. Aipom also shares its large smile with a cymbal-banging monkey toy. It is also similar to an ahuizotl, a creature of Aztec mythology with monkey hands and a fifth human hand on its tail.Aipom and Eipam may be a combination of ape and palm (referring to the hand on its tail). It may also refer to a pom-pom.

The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly resumes past Arceus's waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is fairly like its mane in shape and coloration. According to legend, it has 1000 arms.Arceus is thought to have created the Sinnoh region and possibly the entire Pokemon world, the lake guardians: Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, and the creation trio: Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the most long-lived of all Pokemon species. It has the power to recreate the creation trio as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. According to the anime, its power can also bring back things that it once destroyed, make certain things vanish into thin air, or to halt time.Arceus is shown to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times and protected it from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion in return to those who treated it with equal kindness. Arceus does not suffer fools gladly, and it will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, it is said to "feed" off the energy of the elemental plates. It is the only known Pokemon that can learn Judgment.Arceus made its debut in Arceus and the Jewel of Life. It was angry at the people of Michina Town for Damos's unwitting betrayal of it in ancient times, and so attempted to destroy the land. When Ash and his friends are teleported by Dialga to ancient times, they directly influence the event, changing the future for the better so that Arceus will stop its destruction.In Battle Finale of Legend!, although Arceus is neither seen or named, the Red Chain is said to contain the power of 'The Original One'. Using the Red Chain, Cyrus takes control of Dialga and Palkia by causing a red ring similar to the one surrounding Arceus's body to appear around their bodies.Arceus appears as a central character in the Arceus and the Jewel of Life manga adaptation, reprising its role from the film. After Arceus saved the world from a meteor, Damos took care of it. It gave Damos the Jewel of Life to make the land of Michina Town rich and fertile. Damos then "betrayed" Arceus, and it has been outraged ever since.In the HeartGold & SoulSilver chapter, Arceus appears as one of the main antagonists, where it plans on destroying humanity due to its mistrust of humans. It was the target of Team Rocket's plans to create Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina.Arceus appears in the TCG in all types but Dragon and Fairy, and a player can have as many Arceus cards in their deck as they like, unlike all other cards in the game (besides Basic Energy cards). Cards based on Arceus first appeared in the Arceus expansion set.Arceus appears as a Poke Ball summon in the 3DS version of the game. It will use Gravity to produce a shockwave that brings opponents downwards.A Pokemon said to have hatched from an egg that appeared from nothing. Newly hatched, it created the world and the sky. Its Gravity attack will bring any fighter in midair crashing down to earth. No ground below you? Looks like you're going to go plummeting off the stage as if you'd been hit by a Meteor Smash!A statue of Arceus can be found in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky at Destiny Tower.With Fist PlateWith Sky PlateWith Toxic PlateWith Earth PlateWith Stone PlateWith Insect PlateWith Spooky PlateWith Iron PlateWith Flame PlateWith Splash PlateWith Meadow PlateWith Zap PlateWith Mind PlateWith Icicle PlateWith Draco PlateWith Dread PlateFor the type effectiveness when Arceus is holding a Plate, see type chart. In Generation IV, if Arceus was hacked to be ???-type, this Pokemon is damaged normally by moves of all types.Arceus is particularly based on a creator deity, present in many world cultures. Arceus's stance and general form are similar to Egyptian bull and calf idols, particularly Apis. Based on its official artwork and attack movements in the 3D games, Arceus may be modeled after a horse. The arc on its back may be inspired by the circle arc used to represent reincarnation in Hinduism.The conception of the first god might be influenced by the Shinto gods Kunitokotachi and Amenominakanushi, who summoned Izanami and Izanagi to create Japan with the spear. It may also be a reference to the qilin, a Chinese mythical creature. Its myth is nearly identical to that of the Pangu, the Chinese creation deity. Arceus may also represent or be inspired by the bodhisattva Avalokitevara, who, in Buddhism, is either pictured with eleven heads and one thousand arms (the latter of which is mentioned in Arceus's Pokedex entry) or in a white, four-armed manifestation (which could look similar to Normal-type Arceus).Arceus may be a combination of arch (referring to the highest point), archon (a Greek word that means "ruler" or "lord"), arcanus (Latin for secret sacred mystery), archaic (ancient),  arkh (Greek for beginning), or archetypus (Latin for original), and deus (Latin for god). It may also derive from aureus (golden, in reference to its hooves and wheel), arc (round or ring), or Archeus (an aspect of the astral plane).

Ariados's feet are tipped with tiny hooked claws that enable it to scuttle on ceilings and vertical walls. It spins a single strand of a special string endlessly out of its rear. The string can also be spun from its mouth; however, it is hard to tell which end is which. Rather than making a nest in one specific spot, it wanders in search of food after darkness falls. It will attach silk to its prey and set it free. Later, it tracks the silk to the prey and its friends. Ariados makes its nest in the depths of the forest.Ariados made its debut in Ariados, Amigos under the ownership of Tkichi.Oakley has an Ariados in Pokemon Heroes.An Ariados appeared in All in a Day's Wurmple, under the ownership of Forrester Franklin.Harley's Ariados first appeared in The Saffron Con.An Ariados owned by J appeared in Mutiny in the Bounty!

She uses its string to help her scale buildings.Janine was shown with an Ariados in JBA5.Ariados appeared in Pokemon to the Rescue! of Ginji's Rescue Team.Ariados's appearance is based on the Myrmarachne formicaria spider, but with the prosoma (thorax and head area) and opisthosoma (abdominal area) reversed, fitting with its Pokedex entry.Ariados is named after the Greek myth of Theseus and Ariadne, wherein Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of twine before he entered the Labyrinth to slay the Minotaur, so that he may trail the strand behind him and find his route back to her. Ariados may also be a combination of arachnid (Latin for spider) and  odosu (to threaten) or dos (Spanish for two, used possibly because it has two stingers, or because it is the second form in its evolutionary line).
23 Armaldo (Japanese:  Armaldo) is a dual-type Rock Bug Fossil Pokemon.It evolves from Anorith starting at level 40, after it is revived from a Claw Fossil.Armaldo is a bipedal, amphibious Pokemon, somewhat resembling a mantis shrimp. It is covered with thick, grayish-blue plates. There accents of yellow, black, white, and red throughout its body. Its oblong eyes protrude from the sides of its head. A black pattern with two red, teardrop-shaped spots covered the center of its head and a yellow lower jaw. Three pairs of wing-like appendages extend from the sides of its long, thick neck. A plate of armor on its back has four short spikes and two triangular, yellow-rimmed wings extending from underneath. Its scaled chest and belly are rimmed with yellow lines as well, and there are two large yellow plates in the center of its chest. Its segmented arms extend from holes in these plates, each with a large, black claw. The legs are also segmented, with black knees. A pair of black fins tips its long tail.In ancient times, Armaldo lived on land by the water's-edge, and dived into the ocean to hunt for prey.

Aromatisse is the only known Pokemon capable of learning Aromatic Mist.An Aromatisse appeared in Summer of Discovery! on a video icon.Aromatisse appears to share some traits with a flamenco dancer and a can-can dancer; it seems to draw particular inspiration from the idea of French dancers scandalously revealing their legs. Given the white round area on its face and the adornments on its head it may also draw inspiration from traditional carnival masks and costumes used in central and southern parts of Europe, and masks worn at masquerade balls. Based on its looks, abilities, species name, and general association with scents, Aromatisse was most likely also based on perfume bottles, and shares the "hourglass" figure many fancy perfume bottles also have. Its "beak" also more than likely represents a perfume nozzle, considering the "scent line" extensions on its head as well as its placement on the top of the body. Its fluffy lower body may also be based on powder puffs or other cosmetics applicators. Its perfumes and avian qualities and origins may also mean that Aromatisse and Spritzee are based on plague doctors, who used various perfumes held in bird-like masks to drown out the scent of the plague and deceased.Aromatisse may be derived from aroma, aromatic, or aromatize.Frefuwan may be a combination of fragrance or fresh and  fuwafuwa (light, airy, fluffy).

Sometimes hunger will drive it to descend from the mountains to eat bridges and rails, which makes it a pest. It makes a new suit of armor after evolving, while its old discarded armor is salvaged for making iron products. With one all-out charge, it can demolish even a heavy dump truck. It lives on mountains.Aron first appeared in A Hole Lotta Trouble. Ash, May, Max, Brock and Team Rocket got themselves lost in a cave full of the Iron Armor Pokemon.

In The Legendary Articuno!, there is an Articuno atop a mountain used by a ski resort. This Articuno is rumored to spirit away the lives of lost travelers, but in reality, it is a friendly Pokemon that runs a Snowcone shop. Pikachu, Clefairy and Jigglypuff enter a Snowcone-eating contest at Articuno's shop, and Articuno also rescues an injured Hazel.Articuno first appeared in You know... Articuno! where it was being chased by several Team Rocket Grunts. It is shown to seal itself in a block of ice when it senses the presence of an enemy. It strongly dislikes confrontation. However, in Pokemon Adventures volume 3, Team Rocket was able to temporary get hold of it, together with Moltres and Zapdos. It was used by the then-Rocket Executive Koga to try to finish Red and Blue and succeeded in freezing them, but that turned out to be a strategy to let the ninja master's guard down and attack him from behind when Blue's Charizard unfroze them. After his defeat, it is called upon by Sabrina's Kadabra with Zapdos and merged to form Thu-Fi-Zer, a combination that proved almost unstoppable until Saur, the Ivysaur it knocked out of the wall, saved its Trainers with a web created using Vine Whip and evolved to Venusaur to deliver the final blow with Charizard and Blasty. It at last regains its freedom after the defeat and splits from its fellow birds.Much later, in the GSC saga, it reappears under Green's possession with its fellow birds and is lent to Red in the battle against Will and Karen, who nearly overwhelmed the three with Ho-Oh and Lugia.

As would be expected, its combat moves are based on its cold nature; they include Ice Beam and Blizzard."Articuno reappears as a trophy in the 3DS version of the game.NA: The air around Articuno is always cool, and it can make snow fall on even the hottest of days. It must be the perfect Pokemon to have around in summer! Then again, do you really want to be the one to use a Legendary bird Pokemon as an ice machine? Let's just think this through for a minute.PAL: The air around Articuno is always cool, and it can make snow fall on even the hottest of days. It must be the perfect Pokemon to have around in summer! Then again, do you really want to be the one to use a Legendary Bird Pokemon as an ice machine? You'd just get the cold shoulder from the whole Pokemon community.This Pokemon's appearance is based on the Simurgh, deriving from the Persian  rokh, which is that of a giant arctic bird. Also, its long tail and small body may be reference to the rare bird, the quetzal. It is also anatomically very similar to the White-throated Magpie-jay.Articuno is a combination of arctic (far northern regions of the globe) and uno (Spanish for one, indicating that it is the first in the series of Kanto Legendary birds).Freezer is literally freezer (that which freezes).
27 Audino (Japanese:  Tabunne) is a Normal-type Pokemon.While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon, it can Mega Evolve into Mega Audino using the Audinite.Audino is a bipedal, pink-and-cream Pokemon with oval, blue eyes. The top of its head, its back, and arms are pink, while the lower half of its face, body, ears are cream-colored as well as its front and fingers. The patterning of pink and cream on its chest resembles a jacket. There are three digits on its hands and two on its feet. It has a puffy, white tuft for a tail. Audino has floppy ears with thin, curled extensions on the underside. It can use these ears as radars, and it has an incredible hearing ability. The feelers on its ears act like stethoscopes in that it can feel the beat of another Pokemon's heart, to assess the Pokemon's feelings and overall physical condition. The feelers are also able to determine when an Egg is close to hatching.When Audino Mega Evolves into Mega Audino, it becomes both heavier and taller. The patterning on its stomach, now completely cream, is covered by what resembles a flared lab coat. Most of its body becomes white with pink tips in four places, one on each ear and near the edges of its "coat". Its eyes turn pink and its ears stand upright with longer, curlier feelers. Its tail becomes larger and a smaller tuft of fur is centered on its chest. Two additional, curled feelers extend from under this extra tuft of fur. White fur covers its feet with two small tufts on the heels. Mega Audino can release pulses that reduce hostility, and the secondary feelers can put those who come in contact with them into a deep sleep.[1]Audino made its debut appearance in Dreams by the Yard Full!. Cilan said that the Nurse Joy of Unova use Audino instead of Chansey as nurses.In Where Did You Go, Audino?, a group of Audino mysteriously went missing.An Audino appeared in Curtain Up, Unova League!.Multiple Audino appeared in Secrets From Out of the Fog!.An Audino appeared in The Journalist from Another Region!.An Audino appeared in A Blustery Santalune Gym Battle!.An Audino appeared in A Battle by Any Other Name!.An Audino appeared in The Bonds of Evolution!.An Audino that can Mega Evolve into Mega Audino appeared in SS031.An Audino appeared in Welcome To Striaton City!! as a wild Pokemon battling Bianca.Audino is one of the Pokemon Pauline uses to help run and maintain the Burst Heart Survival tournament.Audino appears as a trophy in the 3DS version of the game.This Pokemon has huge ears and large feelers that look like stethoscopes. It's easy to guess what it's best at! It can pick up even the faintest of sounds perfectly with its feelers, including the heartbeats of other creatures. It can even tell how far away eggs are from hatching.Audino seems to be based on a rabbit with features of a nurse or physician, with its ears acting as stethoscopes. The feelers on its ears also resemble a cochlea, the auditory part of the inner ear.Audino may be derived from audio and a pun on the phrase "I dunno." It may also refer to the suffix ino (which denotes youth) or involve din (loud noise, referring to the fact that it has stethoscopes for ears) or lapin (a term for "rabbit").Tabunne may be derived from  tabun ne ("maybe") or  tabun ("many are heard"). It may also derive from  mimitabu (earlobe).
28 Aurorus (Japanese:  Amaruruga) is a dual-type Rock Ice Fossil Pokemon.It evolves from Amaura when leveled up at night starting at level 39, after it is revived from a Sail Fossil.Aurorus is a quadruped, dinosaurian Pokemon similar to sauropods. It is primarily blue with a lighter underside. There are two lines of small ice crystals running the length of its body, one line on each side. These crystals produce freezing air reaching temperature of -240 degrees Fahrenheit. Aurorus uses this ability to create ice walls for protection.A white, V-shaped mark covers the top of its head with another ice crystal in the center, giving it the appearance of wearing a tiara or a headress. Two large, flowing sails extend from the top of its head and run down its long neck. The sails are pale whitish-yellow at the base, and fade into a pale bluish-purple at the edges. There are three clawed toes on its hind legs, but one large nail and a single claw on its forelegs. The tip of its long, tapering tail is teardrop-shaped and curls inward.Aurorus made its debut in Coming Back into the Cold! alongside its pre-evolution, Amaura. Aurorus also appeared in the newspaper in To Find a Fairy Flower!.All Normal-type moves that do damage, that do not normally have STAB, will have STAB if Aurorus has the Ability Refrigerate.Aurorus is based on an Amargasaurus, which were speculated to have possible skin sail extensions on their vertebral spines. It also shares traits with various species of Diplodocoidea. The color-changing sails are also based on auroras, most likely aurora borealis due to its partial Ice typing, and the fact it only evolves at night, when the aurora borealis is most often seen. Similar to Tyrantrum, considering its white, V-shaped mark with an ice crystal covering the top of its head and two flowing extended sails running down its neck, it may have also been based upon a queen, with the mark and the two flowing sails acting as a tiara or a headress worn by queens from medieval times while its body with small ice crystals resembles a dress.Aurorus may be a combination of aurora and Amargasaurus.Amaruruga is from Amargasaurus.
29 Avalugg (Japanese:  Crebase) is an Ice-type Pokemon.It evolves from Bergmite starting at level 37.Avalugg is a massive Pokemon seemingly formed entirely out of reflective ice. Its top half is flat, with three cracks, one before its stubby tail and two in between its four legs. These legs are cylindrical, and also sport purple cracks at its joints and in between its icy toes. Underneath each toe is a spike, similar to cleats. Large icicles hang from its underside, which nearly touch the ground. Avalugg's head is similar to its body, a cracked wedge of ice with a flattened upper surface. Its mouth has a large underbite, which opens up to reveal four small teeth and purple gums. The head has two white diamond-shaped "ears," and from its chin hangs three bulging spikes, resembling a beard.Bergmite are known to huddle on top of Avalugg's back, causing it to resemble an aircraft carrier made out of ice. Its cumbersome frame is as hard as steel, able to crush anything that stands in its way.Avalugg appears to be based on a tabular iceberg or a stalactite. It may be a representation of the submerged part of the iceberg, which is immense in comparison with the tip. Avalugg's Ice typing and being likened to an aircraft carrier may be a reference to Project Habakkuk, a plan conceived by the Allies in World War II to build an aircraft carrier from pykrete, a combination of ice and wood pulp. Its body also somewhat resembles a tortoise, or perhaps a rhinoceros or cerapod.Avalugg may be a combination of avalanche and lug (to carry or drag heavy objects, or a big clumpsy person).Crebase may be a combination of crevasse and base.
30 Axew (Japanese:  Kibago) is a Dragon-type Pokemon.It evolves into Fraxure starting at level 38, which evolves into Haxorus starting at level 48.Axew is a bipedal, grayish-green Pokemon with pale, straight tusks protruding from the sides of its mouth. These tusks can regenerate if broken, and will regrow if they fall out. This repeated regrowth strengthens and sharpens its tusks. The tusks serve numerous purposes, from making territorial gashes in trees to crushing Berries for eating. The back of its head is dark grayish-green with a tall, slightly curved horn. Large, dark grayish-green ovals surround its red eyes, and it has a short, rounded snout with large nostrils. A forest green collar marking encircles its neck.

They are often decorated with patterns representing nature and were buried, occasionally with bronze mirrors and weapons, in isolated locations. Bronzong and the fact that it evolves from Bronzor also seems to be based on an old Japanese myth present in the book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things by Lafcadio Hearn. The priests of Mugenyama wanted to forge a bell for their temple, so they asked the local women to donate their bronze mirrors for this purpose. A woman contributed her mirror, but later regretted it. Because of her repentance, the mirror wouldn't melt in the furnace until she killed herself. Before her suicide, she said that whoever would break the bell would be given great wealth by her ghost. A multitude of people tried to break the bell by ringing it furiously, so the tired priests managed to roll it down a hill into a swamp. Additionally, Bronzong's facial features resemble those of the Mesoamerican rain god Tlaloc, who is often depicted as being predominantly cyan in color. In Mexico City, which is located on the site of the former capital of the Aztec empire, artifacts are often discovered during construction-related excavation, which Bronzong's Pokedex entry in Pokemon Diamond may reference.Bronzong is a combination of bronze and gong (a type of musical percussion instrument) or dong (onomatopoeia for deep bell reverberation).Dohtakun is a combination of  dtaku (bronze bell) and  dondon (onomatopoeia for drumming).

A pair of small, pointed teeth visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws.

The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokemon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokemon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokemon and soothingly rocks the young one in the air.It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokemon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to become Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.Ash's Bulbasaur debuted in Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village as one of the Pokemon in the Hidden Village. Though initially wary of Ash, the two eventually warmed up to one another, and Bulbasaur challenged him to a battle. Using Pikachu, Ash won the battle, and Bulbasaur was captured.

From birth, Bulbasaur carries a large plant seed on its back. It uses the nutrients from the seed to grow bigger and bigger. Extended exposure to the sun will cause its body and seed to grow in size. Some say that once, when the seed was much lighter, Bulbasaur was able to get around on two legs. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur."Bulbasaur appears to be based primarily on some form of reptile, specifically mammal-like reptiles known as Dicynodonts from the Permian period. Along with visible ears and no genuine metamorphosis stage (evolution aside), Bulbasaur appears to have more in common with mammals than amphibians such as frogs and toads, which metamorphose from one definite creature into another as they mature as opposed to just growing into a larger adult version of itself the way that Bulbasaur does. Alternatively, Bulbasaur's large rounded snout, wide mouth, wide-set eyes, blotch-patterned skin, and quadraped-like movements are vaguely similar to those of certain amphibians, such as the common toad. Since Bulbasaur's "ears" do not in fact have hollows, they may actually be similar to the glands present behind the eyes of many species of frogs and toads.The bulb on its back may resemble that of a lily or onion.Bulbasaur is a portmanteau of the words bulb (a rounded underground storage organ present in some plants, notably those of the lily family) and the Greek saur (lizard).Fushigidane literally means "isn't it strange?" and is also a pun on  fushigidane (mysterious bulb).

However, the "unleashing of nightmares" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. It can become a shadow and escape danger or contact of humans. It is also capable of little human speech. In The Rise of Darkrai, it was shown its power was little of that of Dialga and Palkia. As seen in an anime episode, Darkrai does not only cause nightmares; it is also attracted to them.

Darkrai possibly feeds off dreams, characterized by its association with never-ending nightmares. Darkrai is the only known Pokemon that learns Dark Void.Darkrai starred in The Rise of Darkrai as the hero of the movie, taking the task of holding off the fighting between Dialga and Palkia until Ash and Dawn could put the Oracin disk in the Space-Time Tower music player to calm the fighting between Palkia and Dialga.

Cresselia is normally in the same place as Darkrai to stop it giving nightmares but due to Darkrai's early coming, the people in Canalave City had nightmares for several days. One night, it was concealing itself when Cresselia used its abilities to reveal it from the darkness. The two then battled and Darkrai hid itself once more in the shadows.In League Unleashed!, a mysterious Trainer in the Lily of the Valley Conference was shown to have a Darkrai. In the following episode, Conway revealed that the Trainer, Tobias, had easily defeated all eight Gyms of Sinnoh using only Darkrai.

It has legs, but seems to prefer to float in the air. Its favourite move in this game is Dark Void. When this attack hits something, it creates a vortex that sucks in fighters and puts them to sleep.Resembling a shadow, Darkrai's appearance suggests it is based on the concept of nightmares. It may have been inspired by the old Arabic myths about genies (or jinn) or the bogeyman. Darkrai could also be based on the concept of Morpheus, the Greek god responsible for shaping dreams. It may also have been based on Phobetor, an Oneiroi being the personification of nightmares.Darkrai is a combination of dark, and  kurai (dark) or "rai" (Hindi for king).

He asks Rowan what happened to "that weird Pokemon". They then see Deoxys, and Rowan is shocked to see such a rare Pokemon. It transforms to Attack Forme and fires off a Psycho Boost at Hareta and Rowan. Rowan tells Hareta not to make it any angrier, but instead he jumps on top of Deoxys and asks what's wrong. It flings him off, then tries to fire another Psycho Boost at him, but he jumps around it, evading it completely. He jumps on it again, but it transforms to Speed Forme while he is still on it. It starts flying around the forest with Hareta, while he asks Deoxys what's wrong once more. It tells him what's wrong, but it throws him off itself. Then he battles Deoxys with his friends from the forest. Onix tries to Headbutt it, but it misses. It transforms to Defense Forme, and then Hareta jumps on Deoxys and covers its eyes. Then he tells a bunch of Kricketune to have a "super bug concert". Rowan compliments him on the super-effectiveness of the attack, then it transforms back to Normal Forme.

It is capable of using Ice Beam to create paths of solid ice on which it moves, similar to Iceman.In Volume 4 of The Electric Tale of Pikachu, Rudy's sister is seen drowning with a Dewgong instead of a Seel like in the anime.Dewgong is based on the aquatic dwelling tropical mammal, the dugong. Its is of the same order as the manatee, which resides in the Western Hemisphere. The four known living members of the order all currently inhabit warm waters, a source of conflict with Dewgong's Ice-type affinity. However, an extinct closer evolutionary relative from the same family (Dugongidae), the Steller's Sea Cow, once existed in the cold Arctic waters of the Bering Sea. While it is suggested that Dewgong was partially inspired by other water dwelling aquatic polar mammals; seals, sea lions, the Harp Seal, the Hooded Seal, the ringed seal, et al.; the Sirenian fossil record suggests the prominence of enlarged incisors that are absent in the modern variants of the dugong, a feature that is noticeable in Dewgong.Dewgong is a portmanteau of dew and dugong (a relative of the manatee). Dew may refer to the natural phenomenon of water vapor condensing in the presence of a cold surface. Dew formation at sufficiently low temperatures turns into frost, a possible reference to Dewgong's dual type affinity.Jugon is a corruption of dugong.

Its trait of fighting with its two shells may be based on Tessenjutsu, a type of martial arts involving the Japanese war fan.Dewott may be a combination of dew, water and otter. It may also involve duel or dual (referring to the two scalchops it fights with), or duo (Italian for two, referring to its place in its evolutionary line). Notably, Helen DeWitt is the name of the author of The Last Samurai.Futachimaru may be a combination of  futatsu (two),  tachi (long sword), and  maru (a common ending in a boy's name, especially in the time of samurai).  futa (alternate reading of ni) may refer to Dewott's place in the evolutionary line.
140 Dialga (Japanese:  Dialga) is a dual-type Steel Dragon Legendary Pokemon.It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon.Dialga is the version mascot of Pokemon Diamond, appearing on the boxart.Along with Palkia and Giratina, it is a member of the creation trio of Sinnoh, representing time.Dialga is a dark blue sauropod-like Pokemon with some gray metallic portions, such as its chestplate, which has a diamond in the center.

Dialga also has two horns on top of its head, two fang-like horns around its mouth, three spines on the back of its neck, long claws, and a short tail. The wing-like structure on its back can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky.Dialga can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, or stopping it altogether. As Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. It has been shown to be very protective of its home. It also tends to have violent conflicts with its counterpart, Palkia. Dialga is the only known Pokemon that can learn Roar of Time.Dialga appeared in the first three Diamond & Pearl series Pokemon movies. It was first shown in The Rise of Darkrai, where it fought with Palkia and Darkrai in a battle that nearly destroyed Alamos Town. The same Dialga appeared in Giratina and the Sky Warrior. On its return trip back to its own dimension, Dialga ended up in the Reverse World and got attacked by Giratina. The Renegade Pokemon had been angered by Dialga and Palkia's fight in the previous movie. Dialga's final movie appearance was in Arceus and the Jewel of Life. It was shown for the first time with both the other members of its trio. After being called by Sheena to stop a spatial distortion, it briefly fought with Giratina once more. Later, it returned to help Palkia and Giratina fight Arceus, and sent Sheena, Ash and his friends back in time to fix Arceus's betrayal.Dialga had a major appearance in The Battle Finale of Legend!, in the conclusion of Team Galactic's plot at Mt. Coronet.

With the combined efforts of Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, the two Pokemon were stopped. The same Dialga would later appear in the Platinum and HeartGold & SoulSilver chaptersIn Pokemon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!, Hareta and Mitsumi set out on a journey with the intention of finding the god-like Pokemon, Dialga. In The Advent of the Legendary Pokemon!! Cyrus successfully controlled Dialga after he gained control of the Red Chain. When Hareta tried to snap Dialga out of Cyrus's control, it was able to flee from Cyrus.In the twelfth movie manga adaption, Dialga, along with the members of its trio, was summoned by Sheena to help Ash and his friends. Dialga, Palkia, Giratina battle Arceus and it soon puts Sheena and the others in the past to uncover the betrayal Sheena's ancestor made.Dialga appears as a stage Pokemon in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, along with Palkia, Cresselia, and the lake guardians on the stage Spear Pillar. It affects the stage much differently than that of its counterpart, such as slowing down time, and even going off its post to attack the players in the middle. It can also distort the stage, like Palkia, but only slightly and not as extreme, as well as shoot beams from various locations."A Temporal Pokemon. This legendary Pokemon is talked about as a deity in fables passed down through generations in the Sinnoh region. Identifiable by the diamondlike crystal in the center of its chest, Dialga is said to have set time in motion at the moment of its birth. Its fearsome Roar of Time attack is so powerful that it must refrain from attacking on the next turn. It is Diamond's mascot."Dialga, along with Palkia, may be based on the Shinto legend of Izanami and Izanagi, who are said to have created one island with a spear, erected a pillar on it, and from there created the islands of Japan. Appearance-wise, Dialga seems to be based on short-necked sauropod dinosaurs such as Camarasaurus or Brachytrachelopan. Its type is Steel possibly due to the hardness of diamonds, or the fact that most parts of a clock are made of metal, such as the gears. It may also be because diamonds are compressed carbon, and steel is a alloy from iron and carbon. Its turquoise pattern on its body is vaguely reminiscent to clock hands, where the ends of the "clock hands" are diamond-shaped.Dialga is derived from diamond. Ga may be a corruption of gon from dragon. It may also involve dia (Spanish for day, referring to a unit of time) or dial (as in sundial, an instrument used to tell time using shadows on a clock face).
141 Diancie (Japanese:  Diancie) is a dual-type Rock Fairy Legendary Pokemon.While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon, it can Mega Evolve into Mega Diancie using the Diancite.Diancie is a gray, sylph-like Pokemon with a white chest and arms that resembles a dress.

A smaller pink crystal is also embedded in the back of its head, and a gold nugget is embedded in its forehead. Its eyes are red with pink irises. A gold crescent circles its neck, with the ends joined by a rhomboid gem. Its lower body resembles a large oblong chunk of stone, with a large pink crystal protruding from it.Mega Diancie retains Diancie's color scheme but instead possesses a dress-like structure made of pink gems and a larger chunk of gem replacing the large chunk of rock. The rhomboid gem on the back of its head becomes rounded and two smaller gems grow from it at the bottom. More gold pieces support the large diamond at the lower body. Its centerpiece becomes heart-cut instead of diamond-cut. It also gains two ribbon-like structures growing from the two small gems on the back of its head and are tipped by two small floating rhomboid gems on each ribbon. The two long pink crystals behind its head shrink into one and two more of these hang from the centerpiece and are also tipped by a small floating rhomboid gem each. A larger gold crescent also circles its torso. Because of its noble beauty, Mega Diancie it is commonly referred to as "the Royal Pink Princess".[1]Diancie is born from a Carbink that undergoes a mutation. It can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air; these diamonds can then be used to defend itself. It can absorb light with a perfect balance and emits a radiance that looks like nothing in the world. According to legends, it can protect its travel partners from accidents and illnesses. Diancie is the only known Pokemon that can learn Diamond Storm.Diancie first appeared in Diancie, Princess of the Diamond Domain, which is set before Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction.Diancie appeared in the manga adaptation of the seventeenth movie.Diancie appeared as a silhouette in the X & Y chapter.

Later as Diantha, Gurkinn and Korrina have followed one of the Shabbonaeu owner's workers in a cave with Diancie, who he reveals he only pretended to work for him to get information about Diancie. After a battle, they are outside the cave where Diancie uses Moon Blast and Diamond Storm to send the guy flying away. Afterwards the Shabbonaeu owner lets Diancie go find a home with the Carbink, before leaving Diancie shows interest in the key stones, and Gurkinn reveals that it is because Diancie is capable of mega evolving as well. Diancie then waves goodbye to the group with the Carbink.Diancie could be based on the carbuncle, a mythical fairy-like creature that was rumored to have a jewel embedded on its forehead.Diancie may be a combination of diamond, fancy, and  ishi (stone). It may also include pixie.
142 Diggersby (Japanese:  Horudo) is a dual-type Normal Ground Pokemon.It evolves from Bunnelby starting at level 20.Diggersby is a bipedal Pokemon resembling a large, portly rabbit. Its most remarkable features are its two ears, which are each crowned with a massive, muscular forearm, complete with three-fingered paws. The ears are furry and mostly grey in coloration, with a pink inner pinna, whereas the paws at the ends of the ears are brown. Three spots of brown fur surround each of the ear-wrists. A pointed protrusion marks the outer elbow, hinting at the presence of bones inside the ear-forearms. These ears are strong enough to lift objects weighing over a ton and prove to be an invaluable asset in Diggersby's digging.The other four limbs growing from Diggersby's round, grey torso are small in comparison to the ears. The fur of the upper paws is white, while the feet are brown. A sash-like band composed of thicker, wooly fur surrounds its waist, where it tends to tuck its paws in. This sash is sectioned brown on its sides and yellow at its front and back; its short tail is also yellow, protruding from the back section of the sash. Diggersby's face is dominated by a large brown muzzle, resembling stubble. Two large front teeth protrude from its wide mouth and three whiskers decorate each cheek. Its eyes are perpetually squinting and it seems to favor a slightly furrowed brow.Diggersby made its anime debut in To Catch a Pokemon Smuggler! under the ownership of Dolan.A Diggersby appeared in Summer of Discovery! on a video icon.Team Flare scientist Aliana owns a Diggersby which she used to take Li'l Kanga from Garu's pouch as a hostage.Diggersby is based on a rabbit. Considering its ability to use its ears as powerful digging and excavating tools, as well as the fact that it hangs out at construction sites, Diggersby is probably based on an excavator and possibly other heavy equipment. The brown fur on its ears resembles excavated dirt or mud. Its tendency to laze about after working, as well as its muzzle and mud-like markings, may also mean Diggersby is based on construction workers as well.Diggersby may be a combination of digger and bunny.Horudo may be a combination of  horu (to dig) or hole and  do (soil) or  to (rabbit).
143 Diglett (Japanese:  Digda) is a Ground-type Pokemon.It evolves into Dugtrio starting at level 26.Diglett is a tiny, brown Pokemon that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head visible.

It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests, and has even been shown to live inside of trees.Diglett first appeared in Dig Those Diglett!. They were causing trouble for a construction crew that was planning on building a dam. The foreman insisted that the Diglett were to be exterminated, but the Pokemon of the Trainers that happened to be in the area refused to fight them. The reason was that the Diglett and Dugtrio were helping to plant trees in the forest.Diglett were also used by a man named Poncho in The Underground Round-Up. He used them to dig tunnels underground of a town that was infested with Electrode. The tunnels sent the Electrode to an open field where they'd live in peace. Poncho also had a Diglett inside his hat.Diglett were also featured in Plant It Now...Diglett Later, helping villagers with crops and being the apparent target of some thieves.Diglett appear in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time & Darkness special as members of the Wigglytuff's Guild.

144 Ditto (Japanese:  Metamon) is a Normal-type Pokemon.It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon.It can breed with any Pokemon other than the Pokemon in the Undiscovered group and itself, including some genderless Pokemon, to produce Eggs of the other's species.In its natural state, Ditto is a light purple or magenta free-form shape blob with vestigial facial features. It also appears to have two vestigial, handless 'arms' protruding from its body. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object. However, if Ditto tries to transform into something based on memory, it may get some of the details wrong. The anime has shown that occasionally a Ditto cannot change its face. Ditto will also be unable to remain in a transformed state if it starts laughing. Ditto cannot mimic the strength of another Pokemon, but it will adapt the form and abilities of its foe. When two Ditto meet in the wild, they will attempt to transform into each other. Ditto will also transform into a rock when sleeping to avoid attack. Ditto is never far from civilization or people.Ditto first appeared in Ditto's Mysterious Mansion. Duplica and her Ditto used to perform for people, but the two had not had an audience since people saw that Ditto could not change its face. Ditto fixed that problem near the end of the episode, when it was captured by Team Rocket.In Hello Pummelo, Drake of the Orange Islands owns a Ditto and uses it to fight Ash's Pikachu. After the battle with Drake's Ditto, Pikachu came out the victor. It reappeared in a flashback in the following episode.Duplica found another Ditto sometime before Imitation Confrontation that she named Mini-Dit.

Finding Ditto appealing, Misty decides to capture one of her own, but the plan is called off when Pikachu goes missing. Ditto also featured in a minicomic in which it transforms into Ash, harasses Misty and thereby getting Ash into a lot of pain.Ditto was the first Pokemon Drake used against Ash in The Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader.In Magical Pokemon Journey, there is a ninja master named Master Ditto who appears several times in the manga. His first appearance is in The Wal Comes Tumbling Down.Additionally, a group of Ditto appear in the fourth bonus chapter of the manga. The Ditto use Transform to mimic Pikachu and cause mischief.In Tauros the Tyrant, Ditto is one of the members on Green's team. As a master of transformation, Green uses Ditto extensively in her schemes, such as morphing over her face to disguise her appearance (like when she infiltrated the Silph Co. building disguised as Sabrina), camouflaging into its background for subterfuge, as well as forming a protective shield with Green's umbrella.A Trainer in the Goldenrod Game Corner is seen with a Ditto in Gligar Glide.Ditto is seen later used by Team Rocket, to lure Crystal and Eusine away from Suicune and smother them when discovered. It was, however, defeated by Crystal's Hitmonchan, Monlee.Ditto is also featured in Pokemon Zensho under the ownership of Satoshi.Green's Ditto debuted in The Big Battle In The Viridian Forest!!.Giovanni was revealed to have a Ditto in Which One is the Real Clefairy!?.

It would have transformed into a copy of the user's character and aided them in battle. However, processing problems forced its removal before the game's release. Ditto can be still be unlocked through the debug menu (which is only accessible through the use of Action Replay), though it does not do anything other than give 7-8% damage to those who touch it.As for its official status, Ditto only appears as a random trophy and as a cameo in the Tournament Mode menu. In Winner Out or Loser Out tournaments, holding down L and R and pressing A will give the player a random character and color. The usual character image will instead be taken by a picture of Ditto.Every Ditto has the ability to copy a Pokemon's entire cell structure in an instant and become its exact replica. They're terrible at remembering techniques, but when they use Transform, they temporarily learn all of their foe's moves. If a Ditto starts to laugh, it weakens and can't hold its transformation.In Generation I, if the player manages to capture an 'M (00), it will still be in battle with the player, and the battle will not end. Catching 'M (00) again results in the second one becoming a Ditto of the same level.The primary method of the Mew glitch involves having a wild Ditto transform into the player's Pokemon, as this copies the Special stat, which is used to modify the species of Pokemon encountered.In Generations I and II, any Pokemon that uses Transform is regarded as a Ditto in its new form; this means that if the player catches a Mew or a glitch Pokemon which has used the move Transform, or a Pokemon which has used Transform via Mirror Move, instead they will obtain a Ditto. Mew turning into Ditto was not an issue, because wild Mew could not have been legitimately encountered. This system was later changed in Generation III, where wild Mew could be legitimately encountered.By trading any Shiny Pokemon to a Generation I game, having a wild Ditto transform into that Pokemon, then catching and trading the Ditto into a Generation II game, the Ditto will be Shiny.In the sixth issue of Best Buy's @Gamer magazine, Game Freak developers Junichi Masuda and Ken Sugimori revealed that Ditto was originally based on the iconic smiley face. Its eyes and mouth are exactly like ":)", which is an emoticon representing the smiley.Additionally, Ditto strongly resembles an amoeba, a single-celled organism with no definite shape. This may emphasize its ability to alter its cellular composition. This could also explain why Ditto is unavailable through breeding, since single-celled organisms reproduce differently from multi-cellular plants and animals. It also could partially be based on an undifferentiated cell, a cell in the body that can change into any other cell by sampling it. It could also have been based on a blob.Ditto is literally ditto, a substitute for repeating what was previously written or said. It was also a common name for copies of master documents created by mimeograph machines, as well as English slang meaning "the same" (in agreement or to copy someone's order).Metamon is a combination of metamorph and monster. Alternatively, Meta as a prefix means "to encompass all," which Ditto's Transform move does do to Pokemon.
145 Dodrio (Japanese:  Dodorio) is a dual-type Normal Flying Pokemon.It evolves from Doduo starting at level 31.Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokemon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black feathered, V-shaped crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its heads and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with anisodactyl feet and sharp claws on each toe. Males have black necks, whereas females have brown necks; both genders have brown legs.Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality, representing and expressing sorrow, anger and joy respectively. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion it may over think and analyze a situation, causing itself to be immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the heads are well known to squabble with one another. Often they will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of the heads gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. Another adaption it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. While two are asleep, one will stand guard and look out for any approaching enemies. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous, and going near it may result in a severe pecking.Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall.Dodrio's first major appearance was in The Flame Pokemon-athon!. Dario used the three-headed bird to compete in a race, but was beaten by Ash who was riding Lara Laramie's Ponyta, after it evolved into Rapidash.Falkner, the Gym Leader of Violet City, used a Dodrio to battle Ash in Fighting Flyer with Fire.Dodrio served as mounts for the Diglett thieves in the episode, Plant It Now...Diglett Later.Gary Oak's Doduo evolved into a Dodrio some time before Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl.

Part Two by Ash, Kellyn, Dawn and Brock to get to the Riolu that J had kidnapped.Dodrio first appeared in Pokemon - I Choose You!, where it has a brief appearance, while shouting its cry to the rising sun like a rooster, notably as the first Pokemon seen in real life in the anime (all Pokemon that had appeared beforehand in the episode were either on TV, in dreams, or not real).Dodrio also appeared in Primeape Goes Bananas and The March of the Exeggutor Squad.A Dodrio also appeared in Pokemon Fashion Flash.Dodrio also made a cameo in A Chansey Operation.

It continues to be her main method of transportation using its quick speed.A Dodrio appeared in The Last Battle XIII as one of the Pokemon sent to help the fight in Ilex Forest.Despite its name, Dodrio seems like it has more in common with ostriches than dodos. It also seems to show some similarity to the Moa, an extinct flightless bird, and the Emu, another flightless bird. It also resembles the Kiwi in some ways as well. Its crests may mean it may have been based on cassowaries.Dodrio is a combination of dodo (an extinct, flightless bird) and trio (group of three).Dodorio may be a combination of  dodo and  trio. To note, dori may be a reference to  tori (bird).
146 Doduo (Japanese:  Dodo) is a dual-type Normal Flying Pokemon.It evolves into Dodrio starting at level 31.Doduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pokemon. Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes with no discernible sclera. It has a soft but bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. The males of the species have black flexible necks, whereas females have brown necks; both genders have brown coloring on their legs. It has two feet, each with four digits ending in a sharp claw.Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is always awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different sets of brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy to be coordinated with one another.

Entei may also have some inspiration from the Aterui, the chief of the Emishi, who was later labeled as a demon called 'Aka-gashira' (Red-Head). It also has the appearance of a volcano, its head is volcano-shaped and has a bright yellow eruption-flame on the top, and the red magma is seen on the side of its face, it has volcanic smoke leaving from the back and has two spiky mountains on the back.Entei may be a combination of  enten (blazing heat) or  en (flame, an alternate reading of hon) and  ktei (emperor).

Often the adult antlion and dragonfly are confused with one another, and Flygon could draw inspiration from both. In fact, some species of dragonflies are commonly called "sand dragons", which could account for Vibrava and Flygon's type combination.

It appeared again in XY052 as a Greninja.Frogadier is based on a frog, and considering its crouched pose, dark blue "hooded" face and upper body, as well as its scarf-like foam, Frogadier is more than likely based on a ninja. The spiked protrusions above its eyes may have been inspired by horned frogs from the genera Megophrys and Ceratophrys. Its bubbling white foam is a reference to frog foam nests, created by some species such as the tngara frog and grey foam-nest tree frog to protect eggs. It was shown in the anime to be able to run on the surface of water, much like the common basilisk.Frogadier may be a combination frog and brigadier or grenadier.Gekogahshier may be a combination of  geko (croak) and  wakagashira (a young Yakuza subordinate leader) or  kogashira (head of an organizational section).

Its protective nature over its Trainer may suggest that it is based on a guardian angel, though its ghost-like characteristics could also suggest that it is based on ghosts that refuse to leave this world.Gardevoir may be a combination of garde (French for guard) and devoir (French for duty). It may also be a combination of garder (French verb for to keep) and voir (French verb for to see), reflected in its Pokedex data, which explains how Gardevoir will protect its Trainer even at the cost of its own life and that Gardevoir has the ability to see into the future.Sirknight may be taken to mean  saa, naito ("come, knight") or Sir Knight.

224 Genesect (Japanese:  Genesect) is a dual-type Bug Steel Mythical Pokemon.Genesect was leaked in the August issue of CoroCoro magazine on July 11, 2012, and it was officially revealed on July 14, 2012.It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon, though the Drive inserted in the cannon on its back is visibly different within its sprites depending on the Drive it is holding.Genesect is the final Pokemon in the Unova Pokedex.Genesect is a bipedal, insectoid Pokemon with a metal body and a saucer-shaped head. It is primarily purple with several gray markings. It has two large red eyes and a small white part that could be either its mouth or a vent. It has thin arms with overlapping segments. Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw. There is a gray circle on each shoulder, and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward curving claw.The powerful cannon on its back and other enhancements were apparently added as part of the bizarre modifications made to it by Team Plasma. It is the only Pokemon capable of learning the move Techno Blast, an attack which changes type depending on the Drive it holds. It is indicated that even before Team Plasma powered up Genesect, it was a skilled and ruthless hunter. By folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect can assume a flying saucer-like form, allowing it to fly. This form is known as the High-Speed Flight Form (Japanese: ). It can also spin a sticky string from its claws.Genesect was revived from a Fossil and technologically enhanced by Team Plasma to create the most powerful Pokemon ever. N had the project cancelled and the P2 Laboratory closed because he felt that Pokemon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back.N discovered an image of a Genesect on a computer monitor at the ruined P2 Laboratory in The Name's N! while he was investigating Team Plasma's plans.The Genesect Army, a group of five Genesect led by a Red Genesect, first appeared in Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!. During his investigations, N found a destroyed building where a Patrat and Watchog were.

In the film, they appear in New Tork City and go on a rampage, bringing them into conflict with a Mewtwo.Genesect was seen as a silhouette at P2 Laboratory. The Shadow Triad was seen testing its power. It later appeared again at the Pokemon League, where it helped Hood Man escape. Later, in the Black 2 & White 2 chapter, Colress attacked Aspertia City with it and came into contact with Lack-Two and Looker, the former of whom ultimately captured Genesect.Genesect was a Pokemon created by Dr. Zeno. After it saved Dr. Zeno from being trapped in his lab, he decided to give it to Arata in order to bring out its full potential.Gensect appears as a Poke Ball summon in the 3DS version of the game after playing Endless Smass at least once. It will jump around the stage, firing four horizontal shots followed up by a wide beam. The attacks are then repeated; both can go through wall.NA: A Bug Steel-type Pokemon, Genesect was created from a 300-million-year-old fossil and later altered to carry a giant cannon on its back. The type of Drive inserted into the cannon affects the attack type of its Techno Blast. It will follow up this attack with a long-range laser.PAL: A Bug- and Steel-type Pokemon revived from a 300-million-year-old fossil, then modified to carry a giant cannon on its back. The type of Drive inserted into the cannon affects the attack type of its Techno Blast. After using this attack mid-jump, it attacks its target with a long-range laser than passes through obstacles.Genesect is generally based on the giant insects of the Paleozoic era, which existed for 300 million years, making it as old as the cockroach. Its Steel-type features that give it a somewhat robotic appearance may be a reference to alien robots in science fiction media, but this may be due to Team Plasma's modifications. Its design might also be inspired by the "Artillery Mech" vehicles in various mecha anime and manga.Genesect may be a combination of gene, genetics, genome, or genesis, and insect.

Its ears have discernible, red, chambered ear insides, and its eyes are yellow. It has six visible fangs in its mouth, and its waist, like its arms, is red and striated.

The fact that its terrible smelling pollen can be made into a wonderful perfume and that 1 in 1000 people enjoy its smell may be a reference to skunks, whose musk has similar qualities.Gloom is taken from the word gloom (a state of depression) and may refer to the gloom associated with smelling its stench or its seemingly depressed face.

Soon afterwards, the Grotle became a Torterra alongside Chimler in Veilstone City fighting a legion of Galactic Grunts, and its power and endurance grew tremendously.Jun's Turtwig evolved into a Grotle off-screen and later into Torterra.Grotle is based on a snapping turtle, but may also originate from a World Turtle, most likely Akpra.

In ancient times it came in conflict with Kyogre, a Pokemon with the ability to expand the oceans. In Pokemon Ruby, Emerald, and Omega Ruby, Groudon is sought after by Team Magma as a major part of their plot to create more habitats for land Pokemon by lowering the sea level.Groudon is the version mascot of Pokemon Ruby and its remake Pokemon Omega Ruby, appearing on the boxart of both.Along with Kyogre and Rayquaza, Groudon is a part of the weather trio.Groudon is a massive, bipedal, dinosaur-like creature covered in red, segmented plates of thick skin that act as armor.

It also has blue stripes inside the seams of its armor plating which can only be seen when Groudon is glowing with power.As Primal Groudon, its appearance is similar to Groudon, but larger in size. Its skin color changes from dark red to deep crimson with its underside and spikes turing black. The spike on its tail are now separate from each other. The Omega symbol is now shown on its arms. Its eyes, armor plating, and inside of its mouth have changed to bright yellow, and its eyes are now red. The stripes inside the armor plating have become larger. The energy that fills Primal Groudon pours forth as magma, and it burns with such an extreme temperature that its body is always shimmering with the haze of its heat.[1] In the anime, Primal Groudon is said to have created new land with every step it takes.It is said to be the creator of land in the Pokemon world, bearing immense power over heat and light and using that to evaporate flooded lands. It sleeps underground in large magma chambers, and causes volcanoes to erupt when it awakens. If it encounters its rival, Kyogre, they will engage in a cataclysmic battle. Groudon is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Precipice Blades.In Jirachi: Wish Maker, a former Team Magma scientist, working as a magician at the carnival, wished to use Jirachi to bring forth a Groudon. However, what he ended up with was not a Groudon, but a manifestation of pure evil that had the appearance of a Groudon. At the end, Jirachi used Doom Desire to destroy the false Groudon.Groudon's first anime appearance was in Gaining Groudon. Team Aqua had captured Groudon but didn't have the correct orb to control it. Team Aqua planned to make a trade with Team Magma, who have captured Kyogre. The trade was about to be made when Archie decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen.

Groudon was finally awakened when Team Magma and Aqua formed a temporary truce to be able to go underwater. Wallace, Brawly, and Roxanne tried to stop the Pokemon's advance but failed due to the interventions of Blaise, Courtney, and Tabitha. Eventually, it reaches its destination: Sootopolis City, to battle Kyogre, which it did for days on end until Ruby, with the aid of a reformed Courtney and his own, Rayquaza-controlling father, managed to quell it. Afterwards, it cut its ties with Kyogre and went to resume its slumber at the bottom of Mt. Chimney. It is shown afterwards that this restored the volcanic activities that Team Aqua had earlier annulled.Ry Tend owns a Groudon which debuted in ABM10.Groudon appeared in Why I Became a Pokemon. The Answer Finally Revealed!! and Tears and Emotions - It's the Final Chapter!.Groudon appeared in PBK4.One Groudon figure has been released.Groudon is obtainable as a Poke Ball Pokemon. Due to its tremendous size, it takes up a lot of the stage, making its attack almost inescapable. It uses Overheat to immolate itself in a fiery aura, causing anyone (except the summoner) who comes into contact with it will be knocked back and receive damage. Its attack is similar to that of Moltres, except that Groudon's is much larger and lasts longer. However, Groudon's attack is significantly weaker than Moltres', as it deals a lighter knock-back and less damage; making it very hard to KO an opponent until they reach a very high damage percentage."A Continent Pokemon. In ancient times, it brought down droughts to save people who had suffered from floods. It is normally found in the profound depths of the earth, where it slumbers in magma. With a mighty roar, it uses Earthquake to mow down enemies. In battle, it summons sunlight to bathe the area. It once had an epic battle with Kyogre."Groudon is modeled after the Earth's land and volcanoes and is most likely based on the Hebrew legends of Behemoth, the unconquerable primal master of the land. Its counterparts were Leviathan and Ziz. Just as Groudon is in conflict with Kyogre, it was said that at the end of time, Behemoth and Leviathan would start a battle that would kill them both. However, the Behemoth is usually depicted as a warthog hippopotamus-like creature; in the same way, Kyogre is not based on traditional depictions of the Leviathan.Instead, Groudon is based on a dinosaur of some kind. Its appearance seems to have drawn inspiration from the Tyrannosaurus and from various species of Ankylosauria, such as Euoplocephalus.Groudon may be a combination of ground and don (Spanish for lord). Don also means tooth in Ancient Greek and is commonly used in dinosaur names, which Groudon somewhat resembles. It may also involve  do (ground) or  don (onomatopoeia for a very loud crashing noise).

Both shisa and sh statues alike are often found in pairs, believed to invite good luck, and used as guardians, which may have inspired Growlithe's protective nature.Growlithe may be a combination of growl and lithe.Gardie may refer to its abilities as a guard dog, as a corruption of guard or guardian.

This would turn out to be a critical development in the manga's plot, as it is through this that Sapphire grows aware of Ruby's real strength.Apart from being a pig, the inspiration for Grumpig may be the Biblical phrase "...neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you" from Matthew 7:6. The pearls were supposed to represent wisdom given to an audience who would not appreciate the teachings. Grumpig and Spoink appear to instead use those pearls of wisdom to enhance their psychic powers.Grumpig may be a combination of grump and pig.

As it matures, it learns Wring Out, a move which is as strong as the remaining strength of the Pokemon.

When it does appear, it's usually running rampant in a destructive rage--behavior that has the unfortunate side effect of leaving whole cities in ruin. It is said that when humans begin a conflict, Gyarados incinerates the towns of both warring parties. There are records of a Gyarados rampage lasting as long as a month. Its pre-evolution form is Magikarp."In Diamond and Pearl a red Gyarados is featured on the TV on a program called "Search for the Red Gyarados." It is this that inspires Lucas or Dawn and their rival to go to Lake Verity, to see if there is a rare Pokemon dwelling in it.It appears to be based on a sea dragon or sea serpent. Gyarados is partially based on a legend about how carp that leapt over the Dragon Gate would become dragons. Several waterfalls and cataracts in China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate. This is referenced by Pokemon Snap, as the player needs to get a Magikarp into a waterfall to evolve it into Gyarados. This legend is an allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles (which can be tied to the fact that Gyarados' pre-evolution, Magikarp, could possibly take a lot of drive and effort to legitimately evolve into Gyarados).Its Flying-type may be a reference of koinobori, a carp-shaped wind sock traditionally flown to celebrate the Children's Day in Japan, formerly called Tango no Sekku ().Gyarados may derive from  gyakusatsu (massacre slaughter) or  gyakky (hardship adversity)both words relate to the creature's violent nature and the hardship it experienced before evolving.

When a war broke out, burning both the Tin Tower and the Brass Tower down, it created Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, and all four disappeared. Later, a new Tin Tower was erected, but Ho-Oh since then has never come back for sure.

It is a symbol of fortune and friendship and will bestow happiness to anyone who simply glimpses it. Many cultures view the Phoenix and Huma as symbols of resurrection; this is seen in Ho-Oh, which was reborn rising from its own ashes and had a hand in resurrecting Suicune, Raikou and Entei.

When the stage transitions to Wikstrom's room, it can be seen in the background along with Steelix, Scizor, and Klinklang.Celosia of Team Flare owns a Honedge, which she used in conjuction with her Aegislash to possess Shauna.Honedge appears to be based conceptually on a fully sentient, possessed magical sword. The fact that it starts off as an ordinary sword may mean it could be based on the bushido mythos behind katana use; katanas possessed the user samurai's soul and attacked of its own free will. In Japanese legends, any object left behind or forgotten by its owner can and will after a while become a tsukumogami, and most commonly in legends, swords or umbrellas were the ones to attack humans. Considering it drains the life of those who wield it, it may have also been based on the cursed tyrfing. Visually, considering its build and hilt, Honedge seems to be based on either a spatha, claymore, or possibly jian sword, with its own scabbard and tassel-like prehensile limb.Honedge may be a combination of hone, one and edge.Hitotsuki may be a combination of  hitotsu (one) and  tsuki (stab, lunge, or thrust) or  tsuki (attached), possibly referring to how the sword is attached to the scabbard even when unsheathed.

On top of its head is a large flame, which is never extinguished. Infernape has an orange, rounded muzzle, long, round ears with blue inside, and a red ridge over its eyes. The eyes themselves are blue with yellow sclera. There are five blue digits on both its feet and hands, and it has a long tail.

It made its debut in Beauty Contest: The Pokemon Super Contest!!, where it represented its Trainer in a Beauty Contest.Y Shirogane has an Infernape which he received it as a Chimchar.Infernape is based on a monkey. The gold elements in its design as well as its Japanese name are most likely linked to Son Goku, the Japanese interpretation of the character Sun Wukong. Sun Wukong is the main character in the Chinese epic Journey to the West and is a monkey with powerful abilities. It is also similar to the Vanara, a race of ape-like humanoids in the Hindu epic Ramayana. It is most likely based off the martial art Muay Thai which uses all the limbs and possibly Monkey Kung Fu, another type of martial arts. It may have also be loosely based on Crazy Monkey Defense, a boxing style that incorporated elements from other martial arts such as Muay Thai.Infernape is a combination of inferno and apeGoukazaru is a combination of  gka (hellfire or inferno) and  saru (monkey).

It will turn over and hit the ground, making all opponents who are on the ground trip.NA: Inkay may look like a Water-type Pokemon, but it's actually a Dark Psychic type! Once it has reached the proper level, Inkay can evolve into Malamar if you hold the Nintendo 3DS upside down. In Smash Bros., its Topsy-Turvy move will flip anyone who wanders too close upside down. Watch out!PAL: A Pokemon that looks this much like a squid MUST be a Water-type, right? Wrong! It's a Dark- and Psychic-type. If you're struggling to get it to evolve, try holding your system upside down. In this game, Inkay's Topsy-Turvy move can knock you over, and you won't be much use like that, so watch out!Inkay is based on a squid or a cuttlefish. Considering its flashing abilities, Inkay may have been inspired by the vampire or humboldt squids, or by deimatic behaviour in cephalopods as a whole.Inkay may be a combination of ink or inkfish and okay.Maaiika may be a combination of  ma (demon) and  ika (cuttlefish or squid) or  maika (Japanese flying squid). It may also involve a pun of  M, iika (Well, whatever; Oh well).
295 Ivysaur (Japanese:  Fushigisou) is a dual-type Grass Poison Pokemon.It evolves from Bulbasaur starting at level 16 and evolves into Venusaur starting at level 32.Ivysaur is a quadruped Pokemon similar to a dinosaur.

It has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth. Each of its feet have three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud. The weight of this bud prevents Ivysaur from standing on its hind legs and forces its legs to grow sturdy. When its plant is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, strong sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. Ivysaur's natural habitat is plains. However, it is rare, as many are in captivity.In Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden, numerous Bulbasaur were seen evolving into Ivysaur, during which Ash's Bulbasaur decided it was too early to evolve.A Trainer named Assunta used an Ivysaur to battle and defeat Ritchie in Friends to the End.An Ivysaur was under the ownership of Crystal in Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl.Ivysaur appeared under the ownership of a teenager named Jimmy in Judgment Day.Ivysaur first appeared in A Chansey Operation, where it was one of the injured Pokemon brought to the clinic.In The Ultimate Test, an Ivysaur was one of the Pokemon owned by the Pokemon League entrance exam instructor.Ivysaur was among the numerous Pokemon who moved closer to the sea as it sensed the disturbance caused by Lawrence III in the second movie, The Power of One.Multiple Ivysaur appeared in the intro of Destiny Deoxys.May's Bulbasaur evolved into an Ivysaur sometime after The Right Place and the Right Mime, which further evolved into a Venusaur prior to Pruning a Passel of Pals!.Jeremy's Ivysaur appeared in a flashback in Weekend Warrior.An Ivysaur owned by an unnamed Coordinator appeared in Playing the Performance Encore!.In I'm Your Venusaur, Ash's Bulbasaur and Pikachu befriend a wild Ivysaur who tells them the legend of a 300-year-old Venusaur, who is the local guardian.

It also uses the projectile attack Razor Leaf. Ivysaur is a Middleweight and uses mostly physical Grass-type attacks. It uses SolarBeam in the Pokemon Trainer's Final Smash, Triple Finish.Bullet SeedRazor LeafVine WhipPokemon ChangeTriple Finish (SolarBeam)[[File:{{{SpeImg}}}|100px]][[File:{{{SpeSImg}}}|100px]][[File:{{{SpeUImg}}}|100px]][[File:{{{SpeDImg}}}|100px]][[File:{{{FSImg}}}|100px]]"A Seed Pokemon that is the evolved form of Bulbasaur. It has a flower bulb on its back, the weight of which has made it develop strong legs and hips. If the blossom gets too big, it can't stand on two legs alone. At a certain level, it evolves into Venusaur. When this happens, the bulb absorbs nutrients and blossoms into a large-petaled flower."Ivysaur appears as a trophy in the 3DS version of the game.NA: Watching your starter Pokemon evolve is an unforgettable experience. For many trainers, that first happened when Bulbasaur became Ivysaur. It might be difficult to say good-bye to cute little Bulbasaur, but before they know it, they'll be saying bye to Ivysaur, too, as it turns into a fully grown Venusaur!Ivysaur appears to be based primarily on some form of reptile, specifically mammal-like reptiles known as Dicynodonts from the Permian period. Along with visible ears and no genuine metamorphosis stage (evolution aside), Ivysaur appears to have more in common with mammals than amphibians such as frogs and toads, which metamorphose from one definite creature into another as they mature as opposed to just growing into a larger adult version of itself the way that Bulbasaur does. Alternatively, Ivysaur's large rounded snout, wide mouth, wide-set eyes, blotch-patterned skin, and quadraped-like movements are vaguely similar to those of certain amphibians, such as the common toad. Unlike Bulbasaur, Ivysaur's "ears" do have hollows indicating that they are in fact ears and not glands, as seen in many species of frogs and toads.The bulb on its back now resembles the bud of a genus of parasitic flowering plants known as Rafflesia.Ivysaur is a combination of the words ivy (woody climbing or trailing plant genus) and the Greek saur (lizard).Fushigisou can be taken to mean "it seems strange" or   fushigi sou (strange grass).
296 Jellicent (Japanese:  Burungel) is a dual-type Water Ghost Pokemon.It evolves from Frillish starting at level 40.Jellicent is a large jellyfish-like Pokemon whose appearance varies based on gender. Both genders have five tentacles, two of which are long with petal-shaped ends. The remaining three are short and tapered. A male is blue with a short, white crown, and a white, moustache-like collar. Its eyes are red with blue sclera, and there is one eyelash over each eye. It long tentacles have white edges, while its short tentacles have white spots. A female is pink with a tall, white crown and a puffy, white collar. Its eyes will be blue with red sclera and be surrounded by two eyelashes. Its mouth is red and heart-shaped. The long tentacles have white edges like the male, but the short ones will have white frills.Jellicent can absorb seawater then project it from its head, which lets it move forward in the sea. Any ship or crew that wanders into the oceans where it dwells is never found again, and it is known to feed on life energy.Jellicent of both genders appeared in Guarding the Guardian of the Mountain! under the ownership of Rizzo.A male Jellicent appeared in The Road to Humilau! under the ownership of Marlon.Male and female Jellicent first appeared in WhiteVictini and Zekrom and BlackVictini and Reshiram.A female Jellicent appeared in Strong Strategy Steals the Show! under the ownership of Manning.Shauntal has a female Jellicent which was used to provoke Thundurus and Tornadus into fighting each other.Marlon owns a male Jellicent which was used in the Pokemon League to battle the Hood Man's Beheeyem and lost.A female Jellicent appears as the Burst form of Rurimaru.Jellicent and its pre-evolution were most likely inspired by the Nurarihyon, a jellyfish youkai that is either shown as a demonized jellyfish or as a jellyfish-like man who wears refined, sometimes regal, clothing. It is also possible that they were inspired by the Kurage no Hinotama, a sort of jellyfish-like will-o'-the-wisp. Its design is inspired by the jellyfish (in particular the Crown Jellyfish and Jelly Blubber) and monarch attire; the male's appearance is based on a king's while the female's is based on a queen's. The Moon Jellyfish may have influenced Jellicent being a ghost type. Its dangerous ability to prey on humans, in self-defense of its habitat, is possibly based on the Box jellyfish and other highly venomous species of jellyfish that can kill humans. The two larger tentacles Jellicent possesses are more similar to those of squids than the tentacles of real jellyfish. Jellicent also has traits in common with sea monsters like the Kraken, most notably its rumored penchant for destroying ships and feeding on the crew.Jellicent is a combination of jellyfish and magnificent or translucent.Burungel is a combination of blue and angel (reference to sea angels).
297 Jigglypuff (Japanese:  Purin) is a dual-type Normal Fairy Pokemon, and prior to Generation VI, a pure Normal-type Pokemon.It evolves from Igglybuff when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone.Jigglypuff is a round, pink ball with pointed ears and large, blue eyes. It has rubbery, balloon-like skin and small, stubby arms and somewhat long feet. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur. As seen in Pokemon Stadium, it is filled with air, as a defeated Jigglypuff, deflates until it is flat. By drawing extra air into its body, it is able to float as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.Jigglypuff uses its eyes to mesmerize opponents. Once it achieves this, it will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing lullaby. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its own life by continuing to sing until its lungs run out of air. It is able to adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Jigglypuff can mostly be found in lush green plains and grassy meadows.From The Song of Jigglypuff through the end of the Johto series, a wild Jigglypuff followed Ash Ketchum's group, intent on performing its trademark song without causing its audience to fall asleep.

298 Jirachi (Japanese:  Jirachi) is a dual-type Steel Psychic Legendary Pokemon.It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon.Jirachi is a small, white, humanoid Pokemon. It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third eye, known as its "true" eye. Additionally, it has a normal pair of circular eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a blue tag, known as a "wish tag". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from this Pokemons back, resembling comet tails.Jirachi hibernates for extensive periods, forming a protective crystalline shell as it sleeps. However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep if it is in danger. It awakens for seven days every thousand year, but can also waken if sung to by a voice of purity. During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, in the anime, Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. In the Pokemon Adventures manga, Jirachi's wishes are granted by writing on the three tags located on its head. Due to only having three tags, Jirachi can only grant three wishes. The anime further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the Millennium Comet, and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. Although it is extremely rare, Jirachi can be found in the mountains.Jirachi's only major anime appearance was in Jirachi: Wish Maker. Jirachi will only awaken during the week of the thousand-year comet and if there is a partner that can be its friend. Max filled that role in the movie. However, Butler wanted to use Jirachi's powers to awaken Groudon. When Butler gained control of Jirachi, he forced it to use its power, inadvertently creating a fake Groudon that would devour everything in sight with its liquid-like tentacles. With the help of Butler, Max, and Ash, Jirachi managed to destroy the Groudon with Doom Desire.Jirachi made its TV debut in Searching for a Wish!.A Jirachi appeared in the Pokemon short PK26.A Jirachi also had a very brief cameo in the opening of Destiny Deoxys and The Rise of Darkrai. In the English dub of Journey to the Starting Line!, Professor Oak mentioned doing reports on Jirachi, which caused him to nearly miss his breakfast.A Jirachi made a cameo appearance in the ending credits in Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade.The seven days Jirachi was awake coincided with the seven days of the opening ceremonies for the Battle Frontier. At the request of Professor Oak, Emerald tried to capture Jirachi while he was there. However, Guile Hideout managed to capture Jirachi first. At the end of the chapter, Jirachi opens its third eye to Emerald and revives the five petrified Pokedex Holders, and goes back into its lengthy slumber as Emerald thanks it.Jirachi appears as a rare Poke Ball Pokemon in its first appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series. The chance of it appearing is 1 in 493 (the amount of Pokemon in the Generation IV National Pokedex). Like the other "secret" Pokemon, it drops rare items instead of just flying away. In Jirachi's case, the items are stickers.A Wish Pokemon. It's said to awaken for seven days once every thousand years, with the ability to grant any wish asked of it. It is truly a Pokemon of which dreams are made. In combat it uses its wish power to attack. Its attack, Doom Desire, which causes light to rain down from the heavens to do tremendous damage, is especially powerful.Jirachi's design and ability of granting wishes probably refer to the habit of "wishing upon a star", so that the wish will come true. Considering its humanoid appearance and ability to grant wishes, it is also possible that it was inspired by Arabic myths about genies, or djinn. In some myths, imprisoned genies would grant wishes to the person who released them. The tags of paper on its head are a reference toward the paper strips (, tanzaku) written on Tanabata.Jirachi is derived from  zhelat (Russian for wish). It may also involve  sachi (wish, happiness, or fortune).

Which is the Most Delicious?.Giovanni sent out a Jolteon when he was about to destroy Pallet Town with a missile in PM047.Its physical anatomy seems to be primarily based on a herding dog or possibly a fennec fox, with several traits of coyotes. It is also feline-like; its extremely high speed resembles that of a cheetah's. It may also be inspired by the raij, a beast from Japanese mythology whose body is made of thunder, and may take the form of a cat.Jolteon is a combination of jolt and eon (an immeasurably long period of time, possibly referring to how long evolution takes naturally).

Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair.Joltik is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokemon and feeds off their static electricity. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the anime, Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. It has been demonstrated that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and in serious danger. Joltik, and its evolution Galvantula, are the only Pokemon that can learn Electroweb by leveling up.Joltik first appeared in Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!, where a wild Joltik was accidentally mistaken as Ash's Oshawott's missing scalchop. When Oshawott put it on his stomach, the angry Joltik started to shock Oshawott until it was taken off.Sylvester owns a Joltik that he used to battle Georgia in Reunion Battles In Nimbasa! during the Club Battle, but they lost.Many Joltik appeared in Crisis at Chargestone Cave!.

Three cotton puffs, almost as large as the body itself, extend off it: one on each arm, and one on top of its head. These puffs produce cotton spores that it can use to float in the air, and it can control its flight even in a hurricane. Three to four leaves grow at the base of the top puff.Jumpluff drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe. It will spread spores as it floats around to create offspring. It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating. Though it spends a good amount of time in the air, it is commonly sighted above open grasslands, as there is an abundance of breezes in areas free of trees so the spores have space to be blown.Jumpluff's debut was in Bulbasaur... the Ambassador! where multiple of them were feuding with the other Pokemon at Professor Oak's Laboratory.Officer Jenny had a Jumpluff in An Egg-Sighting Adventure!.

Its two hands closely resemble pom-poms, and its movements in the console games, such as Pokemon Stadium 2 and Pokemon Colosseum, also bring to mind a cheerleader.Jumpluff is a combination of jump and fluff. It could also be a corruption of plush, meaning a soft object or an object made of felt.

She was used to attack Red and Green after they tricked Team Rocket and capture Mew. When she attacked Mew, Red and Green tried to defend it, only to be defeated. Mew retaliates against her and freezes her and Ken while sparing Red and Green.Jynx's most notable role is being under the ownership of Lorelei in Pokemon Adventures which first appeared in Jigglypuff Jive. Lorelei's Jynx is noted for having the ability to generate voodoo dolls out of ice using its Ice Beam. When Lorelei draws crosses on any part of the dolls using her lipstick, ice shackles form on the specified body parts of her targets, eventually freezing the victim over completely. Even after the victims are broken free, the freeze induces lasting numbness in the areas where it was applied. Both Red and Sabrina suffered this condition and had to seek a cure atop Mt. Silver by bathing in the hotsprings there. Another ability of Lorelei's Jynx is revealed in the Sevii Islands saga: she can create a wispy band of ice around targets, which Lorelei can use to track them down using her powder case.Later a Jynx appeared in The Last Battle XIII as one of the Pokemon sent to help the fight in Ilex Forest.A Jynx took part in a baseball match with Red in Fierce Competition at the Pokemon Baseball Tournament!.Sh has a Jynx in the Pokemon Gotta Catch 'Em All manga.Jynx originally bore a striking, but possibly coincidental, resemblance to entertainers in blackface. It is argued that Jynx may instead be a parody of or homage to the Japanese ganguro and yamanba fashion trends, which were extremely popular when Pokemon was first released; however, blackface-influenced characters have appeared in other anime and manga such as Dragon Ball's Mr. Popo and in Metropolis.As Pokemon became more popular in the US, this perceived similarity to a racist image from America's past offended some. In particular, it had offended children's book author Carole Boston Weatherford, who accused Jynx of being a racist stereotype in an article titled "Politically Incorrect Pokemon" in the magazine Black World Today, shortly after the anime episode Holiday Hi-Jynx aired. Episodes that contained Jynx in its original design were left unaired outside of Japan, including EP250 and portions of All Things Bright and Beautifly, with the exceptions of Stage Fight!, The Mandarin Island Miss Match, and the Who's That Pokemon? segment of It's Mr. Mime Time.In response to this controversy, Nintendo changed the color of Jynx's dark blue hands and its black face to purple in Pokemon games, including in the international versions of Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In addition to this, Jynx's facial expression in its Silver sprites were also changed, as was its hair color in both her normal and Shiny forms. Jynx has since appeared using its new design, with the exception of some side-games, free of issues. The Virtual Console versions of Pokemon Snap and Pokemon Trading Card Game recolor Jynx's face.What Jynx is based on is a controversial topic within the fandom, although common interpretations are a Nordic or a Viking woman (possibly Hel, goddess of the underworld), or  ganguro (face-black). Also, the fact that Jynx are depicted as Santa's helpers in the anime may reference the folklore character Zwarte Piet. Jynx also has the traits of a female opera singer, especially the iconic cartoon depiction of the fat lady; it should also be noted that Pokemon Snap and the third generation sprites depict it singing, especially the Emerald sprite that animates it singing a high note. Jynx may also have origins in the Japanese spirits known as Yuki-onna, who lack feet, akin to Jynx's feet being covered by its dress, and Yama-uba, which is described as always wearing a tattered red kimono, having whitish-blonde hair, control over snow, dark-colored skin, and large lips, traits which are evident in Jynx.Its revised coloring may be based on purple discoloration of the skin, a common symptom of frostbite. This fits with Jynx's Ice type and how it is found in very cold places.Jynx is a corruption of jinx, a curse or hex of bad luck.Rougela may be a feminized corruption of rouge, a type of makeup. It is also French for red.

The structure of its body is almost entirely unknown, except its four short, yellow legs and luminescent red eyes on its underside. Having been thought extinct as of roughly 300 million years ago, in modern days, most living Kabuto are resurrected from Dome fossils.Although Kabuto have been found fossilized by way of lying on the ocean floor for millenniums, on rare occasions, it has been found still living. In its original time, it was prominently found on beaches, likely aided by its fast and powerful swimming ability. As seen in the anime, Kabuto prefer seclusion and can be very territorial.Kabuto was one of the Fossil Pokemon that attacked Ash and Team Rocket until being scared off by an Aerodactyl in Attack of the Prehistoric Pokemon.In Shell Shock!, a "deranged old man" named Umberto was saying that an island full of Kabuto Fossils would sink once the moon casted a red glow. He was right, because the Fossils came to life and the island collapsed, since the Fossils kept the island together.In Dealing With Defensive Types!, a Kabuto, along with an Omanyte and Omastar, attacked Team Rocket in the Canalave Gym.Bill was trapped in a Kabuto costume at the beginning of Mystery at the Lighthouse.A Kabuto appeared in a fantasy in A Ruin with a View.A Kabuto appeared in a fantasy in Where's Armaldo?.A Kabuto appeared in the opening of Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.A Mirage Kabuto appeared in a flashback in The Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon.A Kabuto appeared in Wild in the Streets!.A Kabuto Fossil is seen in A Night in the Nacrene City Museum! as an exhibit in the Nacrene City Museum.Brock rescued the employees of the Pewter City Museum and got a Kabuto as thanks in Striking Golduck.

Kabuto is also the Japanese word for helmet, specifically the traditional helmets samurai wear.
304 Kabutops (Japanese:  Kabutops) is a dual-type Rock Water Fossil Pokemon.It evolves from Kabuto starting at level 40, after it is revived from a Dome Fossil.With a body closely resembling a living skeleton, Kabutops has a half-moon, disc shaped head, with two small, forward facing eyes. Its body has a light gray chest plate with a brown shell resembling a visible backbone, containing three ribs protruding on each side and a thick pointed tail. It does not have hands, but large, sharp, gray scythes. Its legs are brown and thin, leading into small feet with two large gray claws.Kabutops can tuck in its shell to help it swim extremely fast in its ocean home, where it can catch prey. It uses its sharp scythes to cut enemies and drink their internal fluids. Before it went extinct, it was in the process of evolving into a land dweller in order to catch prey that had already evolved into land dwelling species. As seen in the anime, Kabutops greatly prefer to live in seclusion, and will become very hostile when provoked.Kabutops's first true appearance is in Attack of the Prehistoric Pokemon. It was one of the Fossil Pokemon that was awakened by a dynamite explosion in Grampa Canyon.A giant Kabutops also appeared in Pokemon Heroes. Oakley used ancient DNA to resurrect a Kabutops and an Aerodactyl to chase after Ash and Latias. In the English dub, they were once used by an evil Pokemon Trainer to torment the civilians of Alto Mare, but were drowned when a Latios brought water to the city. They have blank, yellow-tinted eyes with no pupils and are lined with a thick black outline.A Kabutops escaped the Oreburgh museum in Wild in the Streets!.Another one appeared in Dealing With Defensive Types! at the Canalave Gym.Kabutops first seems to appear in Island of the Giant Pokemon on a theme park island populated with giant mechanical Pokemon.Dr. Yung uses a Mirage Kabutops in The Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon.A Kabutops appeared in the opening of Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.Red used a Kabutops in File 3: Giovanni during his Gym battle against Giovanni.Kabutops debuted in Just a Spearow Carrier where it battled against Red's Poliwrath but was deafeated afterwards.In Capital Kabutops, Brock possesses a Kabutops in his team. He explains that he met Kabutops at the Pewter Museum when Pewter City was invaded during the Elite Four saga, and has since then become a powerful fighter employing ancient attacks.Similarly to how Kabuto is based on horseshoe crabs, it resembles eurypterids, prehistoric arthropods which hunted in seas and rivers and are believed to have been related to modern horseshoe crabs. The large head is also identical to the cephalon in trilobites and the spines down the back resemble thoracic sections in trilobites, though the scythes and predatory nature much more closely resemble eurypterids. Because of these cross-similarities, it may also be based on the Cheirurus genus of trilobites.Kabutops derives from both  kabuto (helmet) and  kabutogani (horseshoe crab). Tops might refer to the living fossil triops or that its helmet is now on the top of its head and no longer covers its whole body.

When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. Kadabra can double the amplitude of its alpha waves when holding its spoon, and can increase it even further by closing its eyes. The waves increase further in strength the more danger Kadabra faces. All of Kadabra's brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. Kadabra lives in urban areas.Sabrina, the Gym Leader of Saffron City, has a Kadabra that evolved from an Abra in Abra and the Psychic Showdown and was used against Ash.

It also shares similarities with goats and foxes, two animals mythologically tied to magic. The symbols on Kadabra's forehead and abdomen appear to be references to Zener cards, a small deck of symbols used in experiments to test for extrasensory perception and clairvoyance in the early 1930s.Kadabra is part of an incantation used in stage magic, Abracadabra. It may also derive from the Spanish word cabra (goat).Yungerer is a corruption of Uri Geller (with  ri replaced by the visually similar  n), who claims to have the ability to bend spoons with his mind, as the Japanese names of the Abra line are based on famous mystics. As a result, Geller attempted to sue Nintendo of America for using his likeness in a character, but lost.

310 Keldeo (Japanese:  Keldeo) is a dual-type Water Fighting Legendary Pokemon.While it is not known to evolve into or from any Pokemon, it has a second form, which is activated by triggering an event in the Pledge Grove, where Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion teach it Secret Sword, and it changes its form permanently as long as it knows Secret Sword. Its original form, Ordinary Form, will then become Resolute Form.Keldeo was leaked on a photo of a page from CoroCoro magazine on February 13, 2012, and it was officially revealed on February 15, 2012. Its Resolute Form was officially revealed June 13, 2012.Along with Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion, Keldeo is a member of the Swords of Justice.Keldeo is a quadruped, colt-like Pokemon with a cream-colored body.

Its tail is light blue with white spots and resembles an elaborate feather in a cap.Upon learning Secret Sword in Pledge Grove, Keldeo transforms into its Resolute Forme. The dark blue protrusions become shorter and lighter in color, resembling ears. Its horn becomes dark blue, and grows larger and ridged. On the side of its head are three feathers colored aqua blue, green and orange.Keldeo tends to cross the world, and often appears at beautiful watersides. It can walk across water by ejecting water from its hooves. It is thought that when Keldeo becomes resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter.Long ago, a fire started in the Moor of Icirrus because of a war among people. In this fire, Keldeo was separated from its parents, but together, Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion took care of Keldeo. They acted as its parents, and they taught it knowledge and moves for survival. Keldeo eventually grew and even surpassed the three Pokemon. One day, Keldeo took off from the forest with no one knowing why.When the four meet again, they teach Keldeo the move Secret Sword.Keldeo made its debut in the fifteenth Pokemon movie Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, being one of its stars along with Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion and Kyurem.

In its Resolute form, its horn grows longer and its vision improves. It can also use Secret Sword in that Form, and that's what it will do in this game. If Keldeo starts charging after you, watch out - that huge horn will send you flying!Keldeo is most likely based on the legend of the kelpie, a supernatural water horse that sometimes appeared as a lost pony. Keldeo is also likely based on the kirin also referred to as the "Chinese unicorn" which are often depicted with a single backwards curving horn and possess the ability to walk on water. Keldeo also draws inspiration from the character of d'Artagnan from the novel The Three Musketeers. Like d'Artagnan, it is the latest and youngest addition to the group. Keldeo's tail also resembles d'Artagnan's trademark feathered cap.Keldeo may be derived from kelda (Old Norse for spring fountain) or may be a combination of kelpie, (a water horse from Celtic folklore) and rodeo (a sport involving skills with horses, cows, and other livestock). Furthermore, "deo" is Latin for "god".

The fact that it dwells on the sea floor while creating whirlpools may be based on the mythical monster Charybdis. Its secondary Dragon-type may be a reference to a Japanese name for seahorses,  tatsu-no-otoshigo, which means "dragon's child", and to the legends of Ryjin and East Asian dragons, where they are said to bear power over the seas of the world, live on the floors of deep bodies of water, and are also known for their weather like ascensions into the heavens.Kingdra may be a combination of king and dragon or hydra (a mythological sea creature).

Kyogre generally lives deep in the ocean, and is said to rest in a deep trench. Kyogre is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Origin Pulse.Kyogre's first anime appearance was in Gaining Groudon. Team Magma had captured Kyogre but didn't have the correct orb to control it. Team Magma planned to make a trade with Team Aqua, who had captured Groudon. The trade was about to be made when Archie decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen. The battle between Kyogre and Groudon occurred during the following episode, The Scuffle of Legends.Kyogre appeared in the movie Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. It had appeared along with countless other Water Pokemon when Ash replaced all of the Sea Crown's crystals. However, when The Phantom attempted to make all the Water types panic using supersonic waves from his ship, Kyogre too was part of the ensuing commotion. Manaphy calmed them down using Heart Swap to rid the Pokemon of their confusion, and some Wailord broke open The Phantom's ship, followed by some Chinchou swimming into the opening and short-circuiting the ship.

Ruby, having trapped Sapphire in Wallace's air car for her safety, was joined by a reformed Courtney and succeeded in quelling both the titans using the Red and Blue Orbs and Norman's temporary control over Rayquaza. However, even after Kyogre returned to the Seafloor Cavern, Archie and Maxie still had plans of reawakening them to kill off anyone who'd oppose their will using the two orbs. Once they were thwarted, the arc ended.In the Emerald chapter, Guile Hideout succeeded in having Jirachi create a Kyogre monster that nearly sank the entire Battle Frontier.Ry Tend owns a Kyogre which debuted in ABM14.One Kyogre figure has been released.After being released from a Poke Ball, Kyogre opens its mouth and squirts out a stream of water.

It will use Hydro Pump to send fighters flying off the stage, and then proceed to chase after them to mae recovering from the attack a nightmare.Kyogre is most likely based on the Hebrew legends of Leviathan, the unconquerable primal master of the sea. Its counterparts were Behemoth and Ziz. Just as Kyogre is in conflict with Groudon, it was said that at the end of time Leviathan and Behemoth would start a battle that would kill them both. The Hebrew word for Leviathan is now used for whales in modern Hebrew, which may be why Kyogre's appearance also draws inspiration from whales, especially the orca.Kyogre and Kaiorga may be a combination of  kai (ocean) and orca (a species described as a whale, but is more closely related to dolphins). Notably, it may also involve  kai (king of the sea), which are the first two characters in  Kaisei (Neptune). It may also be derived from eygre, a tidal phenomenon.
325 Kyurem (Japanese:  Kyurem) is a dual-type Dragon Ice Legendary Pokemon.While it is not known to evolve into or from any Pokemon, it has two other formes, which are activated by using the DNA Splicers on it and either Reshiram or Zekrom, resulting in a process called Absofusion that removes Reshiram or Zekrom from the party until the fusion is undone. It will then become White Kyurem (with Reshiram) or Black Kyurem (with Zekrom). However, it is impossible to own a White Kyurem and a Black Kyurem at the same time, as the game rejects the second fusion of Kyurem with Reshiram Zekrom.Along with Reshiram and Zekrom, Kyurem is a member of the Tao trio, which exists in the legends of the Unova region.As both Black Kyurem and White Kyurem, it is the version mascot of Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, respectively.Kyurem is a gray and blue, bipedal Pokemon of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. Kyurem has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, has a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head and a yellow crest on its skull. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms and tail. It has two arms, each with its own claw and each arm is jointed together from its oddly shaped blue wings, which are believed to be used for flying and storing cold air. Each wing has two spikes of ice. The ice covering the wings can break, revealing gray tendril-like appendages on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender, and has three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.Kyurem has two alternate forms, White Kyurem and Black Kyurem, which are formed by combining with Reshiram and Zekrom, respectively, and share many aspects of their designs with them. It can use Absofusion on their respective Dragon Stones to change to White or Black Kyurem. When transformed into either, its legs are just like before, but shorter and the middle toe is now ice. As White Kyurem, it has some extra icy details on the legs. Its tail resembles that of Reshiram or Zekrom, but they are attached to the body with three gray parts of skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains four holes: they are horizontal on White Kyurem and vertical on Black Kyurem. The torsos of each form are similar, but White Kyurem's torso is more slim than Black Kyurem's bulky torso. Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each which can come out and 'plug in' the aforementioned holes. As White Kyurem, it has thin arms with two rings and three claws each, wings between the rings on its forearms, and its right arm and wing are frozen. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but more muscular and without wings, and its left arm and wing are frozen. Its neck is the same shape, but is now upright; White Kyurem uses Reshiram's fur and Black Kyurem uses Zekrom's skin. In both forms, the ice covering one of Kyurem's jaws (upper for White Kyurem, lower for Black Kyurem) has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth.Kyurem generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out. Due to an old legend, it may be assumed Kyurem may be hostile towards Pokemon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly ate them if they were found outside at night. Kyurem is said to be an extraterrestrial Pokemon according to folklore. It is the only Pokemon that can learn Glaciate, while its alternate forms White Kyurem and Black Kyurem can respectively learn Ice Burn and Freeze Shock instead. White Kyurem and Black Kyurem can also learn Reshiram's and Zekrom's signature moves Fusion Flare and Fusion Bolt, respectively.Kyurem, in all of its forms, made its debut as one of the stars of Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, along with Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion and Keldeo. Kyurem was challenged by Keldeo, who wasn't ready to fight Kyurem, but arrogantly claimed that he was a Sword of Justice. After the terrified Keldeo fled during the middle of the fight, Kyurem relentlessly pursues Keldeo in order to finish the battle they had started. Along with the other legendary Pokemon present in the movie, Kyurem can speak through telepathy.Monta owns a Kyurem.Kyurem appears in its Normal Form as a Master Ball Pokemon. Upon summoning, it releases Icy Wind from its sides to freeze any caught opponents.NA: While this Dragon Ice-type Pokemon is definitely a Pokemon, some believe it is what remained after Reshiram and Zekrom were split apart. In battle, it will generate incredibly cold energy and then unleash it using Icy Wind. This move will deal constant damage before freezing opponents.PAL: Kyurem is thought to be an empty shell left behind when Reshiram and Zekrom split into two. Its icy energy is so powerful that it can freeze its own body. When Kyurem has built up enough energy, it can unleash Icy Wind, shooting spirals of cold left and right. After damaging fighters, this attack with leave them frozen.Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity: Kyurem is a major character in the main story line.DNA Splicers DNA Splicers Kyurem and its two counterparts Reshiram and Zekrom are based on the concept of yin and yang in Taoism. Kyurem, however, symbolizes wuji, the absence of yin and yang. In regards to overall design, it appears to be based on a theropod and a European dragon, similar to Zekrom. Its arms in particular seem to be influenced by Tyrannosaurus rex. Kyurem's type, Ice, may allude to the absence of energy and the concept of absolute zero. Kyurem's rock-like body and its origin story of arriving on Earth like a meteor are references to comets, which are largely composed of ice crystals.Given that its Japanese name contains mu, it may be based on the koan mu.Kyurem may be a combination of  rei (cold),  kyuurei (rapid cooling), or  yuki (snow) with the kana reversed, and  mu (nothing). It may also derive from  rei (zero). Rem may also mimic the rom of Zekrom and the ram of Reshiram.

354 Lugia (Japanese:  Lugia) is a dual-type Psychic Flying Legendary Pokemon.It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon.It is often considered to be closely related to Ho-Oh as a duo, even sometimes as its polar opposite. Silver represents Lugia as "guardian of the seas", and Gold represents Ho-Oh as "guardian of the skies."Lugia is the version mascot of Pokemon Silver, its remake Pokemon SoulSilver, and Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness (as Shadow Lugia), appearing on the boxart of them all.In Pokemon XD, Shadow Lugia, codenamed XD001, is a main part of the storyline, and Cipher's ultimate Shadow Pokemon.Lugia is a large Pokemon that resembles a dragon, a plesiosaur, and a bird.

Its head has a point to the back, and Lugias eyes have pointed blue or black spikes on them.

It can fold back these plates to increase its speed. It has large wings that resemble hands. Though it is genderless, young Lugia has been observed, suggesting that there is a breeding population. Lugia has been shown to be fiercely protective of its young.Lugia leads the Legendary birds. When they fight over territory, Lugia is the only Pokemon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, as observed in the second Pokemon movie. Much like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. It is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear down cliffs. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as 40 days. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. Lugia is the only known Pokemon that learns Aeroblast. It is extremely rare and is hardly ever seen.A Lugia was featured in The Power of One, central to the legend of Shamouti Island. Its psychic powers allow it to communicate with humans.A parent Lugia and its child (nicknamed Silver by Oliver) lived near Silver Rock Isle in the Whirl Islands. Dr. Namba attempted to capture both the parent Lugia and Silver for Giovanni in The Mystery is History, A Parent Trapped!. and A Promise is a Promise. Ash and Misty (Brock was not along with them) act as if this was their first time seeing a Lugia, as if the second movie never took place. Meowth, as well, said that he'd "never seen a Pokemon like that before!" On the contrary, the dub pays mention of the Lugia that was seen in the Orange Islands, with both James and Ash stating that it was "like" the one they'd seen in the Orange Islands. In both versions, Ash first refers to the baby Lugia as a "mysterious Pokemon."Lugia saved Ash, Misty and Brock from being sucked into a whirlpool in Around the Whirlpool. It later turned out to be the mother of Silver in The Mystery is History.A Lugia also appeared in a Team Rocket fantasy in An Egg Scramble!.Lugia made a brief cameo at the beginning of Jirachi: Wish Maker, Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, The Rise of Darkrai, Giratina and the Sky Warrior, Arceus and the Jewel of Life and Zoroark: Master of Illusions.The Elite Four tried to exterminate humans using a Lugia (unnamed at the time) in the Yellow chapter. The Masked Man apparently caught Lugia twice (its plucked feather item Silver Wing is shown under his possession several years ago, only to be stolen by Green), but both times it went back to the wild along with Ho-Oh. It was first encountered in Volume 7 as a being of shimmering light (long before most Generation II Pokemon were known) when Lance summoned it to aid his schemes of eliminating most of mankind, but it wasn't until much later in Volume 12 that it was properly identified as Lugia.

Lugia live quietly in the deepest ocean trenches for one very good reason: its combined aerial and psychic powers are so strong as to be extremely dangerous. The special moves of this gargantuan creature include the destructive wind assault known as Aeroblast."A Diving Pokemon. A legendary Pokemon often referred to as 'guardian of the seas,' it has the impressive ability to control the wind. Lugia typically spends its time quietly at the bottom of the ocean. Highly powerful in all areas, Lugia's Aeroblast move is especially powerful. It uses strong flapping of its wings to target damage on a foe's weak spot."NA: Despite being a Psychic Flying-type Pokemon, Lugia sleeps on the ocean floor. Legend says the flapping of Lugia's wings can create storms that last up to 40 days. It's impossible to know for sure, but in Smash Bros., Lugia definitely brings a storm with its Aeroblast attack.PAL: Despite being a Psychic- and Flying-type, Lugia sleeps on the ocean floor. It's said that if it were to flap its wings on waking up, it could cause a storm lasting 40 days. No one can say whether that's true or not, but Lugia's attacks certainly make it seem so. It flies behind the stage and creates a mighty gust of wind with its Aeroblast attack.Lugia's tendency for being underwater resembles plesiosaurs. It is also possible that Lugia is based on Ryjin, a dragon who lived on the ocean floor and was the Shinto god of the sea. The two have similarities in mythology, and Lugia's Shiny colors (red and white) are the same colors as the coral Ryujin's palace was made of. The beluga whale, a white whale with a similar body shape and coloration to Lugia, may also be a basis for Lugia's design and name. Lugia's back fins and tail spikes are reminiscent of the Stegosaurus.Lugia may be derived from lutetium (a silverish element), which in turn is named after Lutetia (the Roman name for Paris, the city of light). It may also involve Lugeo (Latin for to lie dormant, alluding to the way Lugia lies at the bottom of the sea) and luna (Latin for moon). Alternatively, it may come from beluga whale.

Magcargo's lower body is amorphous and covered in bubbles of magma.Magcargo's internal body temperature can reach over 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit, causing it to evaporate water on contact. Flames circulate throughout its body, occasionally spouting through cracks in its shell.

The barbels are white on a female and tan on a male.A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around. It is not a strong swimmer, and currents in the water will sweep it downstream. It is normally seen using its former signature move, Splash, to leap out of the water, which makes them easy targets to predators such as Pidgeot. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability it usually lives downstream of the water's flow.James's Magikarp debuted in Battle Aboard the St. Anne!, where James buys it from the Magikarp salesman.

Coronet, Chargestone Cave, Kalos Route 13, or New Mauville.Magnemite is a seemingly robotic life form that has a gray, spherical metal body with horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body, and the other on top of its head and looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokedex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, the anime has shown that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. It has even exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph, and has been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.The magnetic units on Magnemite's body create electromagnetic waves that allow it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive, but may approach Trainers with little notice. It can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Poketch. It has even been shown to be attracted to electric Pokemon producing such fields. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, it has been demonstrated that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite do not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will start retaliation with non-damaging moves.Magnemite first appeared in Sparks Fly for Magnemite. Ash and his friends were in Gringey City while the power went out.

Coronet, Chargestone Cave, Kalos Route 13, or on New Mauville.Magneton is the result of three Magnemite being linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when no other Magnemite are in the vicinity. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked via body on the bottom, forming a triangle. However, in some cases, commonly seen in 3D Pokemon games, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remaining in a triangular formation at rest, and being able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. The magnetic forces that holds the three Magnemite together is powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature 3.6 F in the vicinity. It can also be disruptive to electronic devices.Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the anime, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. It has been shown in the manga that it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph, indicating it has existed for at least 1,500 years.Magneton first appeared in Sparks Fly for Magnemite.

370 Magnezone (Japanese:  Jibacoil) is a dual-type Electric Steel Pokemon.It evolves from Magneton when leveled up in either Mt. Coronet, Chargestone Cave, Kalos Route 13, or on New Mauville. It is the final form of Magnemite.Magnezone is the result of Magneton leveling up in the presence of a special magnetic field. The evolution is done on a molecular level, but despite this, scientists have failed at attempts to force it. Magnezone's body is wide and circular, similar to a disc or saucer, with a thin edge circling the diameter of its body. Its main eye is in the center, containing a large, red pupil. On each side of its body, it has a ball shaped addition, with each side containing an eye, horseshoe magnet, and Phillips head screw. On top of its head is a tall, thin, yellow rod, closely resembling an antenna, which it uses for certain attacks. Behind its body is a third horseshoe magnet, positioned like a tail.Magnezone is a seemingly-mechanical, genderless creature, but it has emotions, a way of reproducing, and the need for nourishment. With its magnets, it has the ability to control anti-gravity and float through the air at will. As seen in Giratina and the Sky Warrior and Phantom Thief Pokemon 7, Magnezone's anti-gravity is strong enough to carry humans with ease. Magnezone is rarely seen in the wild, but as seen in the anime, Magnezone can be very aggressive and territorial. However, it will rarely attack unless provoked. Magnezone is said to be one of the best defensive Pokemon yet.Magnezone made its debut in the movie Giratina and the Sky Warrior under the ownership of the main antagonist, Zero. Despite Zero's maniacal behavior, Magnezone was very loyal to him.

His first appearance was in Pokemon Emergency!.His background story, including another female Meowth named Meowzie, was told in Go West Young Meowth.Meowth was cloned in Mewtwo Strikes Back, but his clone couldn't talk or walk on two legs, just like an ordinary Meowth, likely due to the fact that its progenitor needed to learn how to do this.

How purrfect!Junichi Masuda has stated that Meowth is based on Satoshi Tajiri's own pet cat.[citation needed] Meowth seems to be based upon the Japanese legend of the  Maneki Neko, also known as the lucky cat or beckoning cat. According to one legend, a cat raised its paw to welcome a lord and saved his life when a lightning bolt hit the spot where he had been standing. Maneki Neko are often used as charms in restaurants and shops to bring customers or fortune and good luck. Statues of the cat are usually depicted holding a koban, an ancient coin used in Japan, like the one on Meowth's head. Its Japanese species name also suggests it is based on a Bakeneko.Meowth may be a combination of meow (the sound a cat makes) and mouth. The -th may also be borrowed from Nyarth, as both meow and ny are onomatopoeia of a cat's cry.Nyarth may be a combination of  ny (the sound a cat makes) and the switched sounds of  Shamu (Siam, former name of Thailand), becoming  Myasu. Siam relates to a cat breed, the Siamese, which in turn relates to Meowth's evolution, Persian, and the Persian cat breed.

It sleeps at the base of Lake Verity, but once engaged in battle, it will rise from the water to fly around the Sinnoh region. Even if you see this Pokemon after your initial meeting, it'll try to flee battle, so catching it is quite a task.Mesprit is based after a spirit or a sprite and the color magenta. Mesprit and the rest of the trio could possibly have originated from the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which are also called the Three Sacred Treasures. Mesprit would be the Yasakani no Magatama, which embodies benevolence.Mesprit may be a combination of me and esprit (French for spirit) or sprite.Emrit may be a combination of  emu (to smile) or emotion and esprit or sprite.

On either side of the cross, a red eye peers out from a space in Metagross's metallic armor. Its four legs are joined to the main body by ball-and-socket joints. While the upper portion of the legs is relatively thin, they are considerably thicker below the knee. Each leg has three short claws on the end and a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the knee. The legs can be tucked in, allowing Metagross to float in the air.As Mega Metagross, it constantly floats, and its legs become arms. The cross on its face turn pale gold, and it gains two small holes and a spike immediately below the cross, giving the impression of a goatee. Its multiple brains process information simultaneously, enabling it to calmly assess the tide of a battle and defeat its opponent with accuracy. Mega Metagross also uses the psychic power inside its body to launch powerful attacks. Its claws are hard as steel and can easily smash even large chunks of rocks.Metagross is the result of two Metang fusing together. This gives Metagross four brains in total, all connected by a complex network of neurons. Because of these complex connections and the number of brains, this Pokemon is capable of complex calculations and is more intelligent than a supercomputer.

Brawl at Jumpfesta; however, it hovered above the stage before attacking, unlike in the actual game."An Iron Leg Pokemon. When two Beldum combine, they evolve into Metang. In the same way, Metagross is the result of two Metang combining. It's said to have the intelligence to match a supercomputer.

Even Snorlax isn't that heavy! It uses Earthquake by stomping its powerful legs on the ground, sending nearby fighters flying and burying those who come too close. You'll be safe in the air, so use careful timing to stay that way.PAL: A Steel- and Psychic-type Pokemon known as the Iron Leg Pokemon. At 550kg in weight, it's heavier than your average Snorlax. When its Earthquake hits, you'd better hope your far away (or at least in mid-air), because the tremors can launch anybody on the ground. And watch out for its legs! They can stomp you right into the ground!Metagross is similar to a robot. It also appears to be based on a super computer, given its mechanical structure and sheer intelligence, and a spider. It is also reminiscent of a UFO.Metagross may be a combination of metal and cross (referring to its facial feature), gross (referring to its weight [1212 pounds], as a gross is 1212), or gro gross (German for large).

It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 miles per hour, and its claws are able to rip through steel.Metang is formed when two Beldum fuse together. A magnetic nervous system joins the brains of these two Pokemon. This linkage allows Metang to generate a strong, psychokinetic power. This Pokemons high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows Metang to hover in midair. This Pokemon lives on rough terrains.Metang made its debut in Saved by the Beldum after Morrison's Beldum evolved whilst battling against Jump's Electabuzz.In Bibarel Gnaws Best!, the head engineer owns a Metang.A wild Metang appeared in Steeling Peace of Mind!Multiple Metang appeared in Pillars of Friendship! under the ownership of J's henchmen.A Metang appeared in Zoroark: Master of Illusions under the ownership of a Pokemon Baccer participant.Steven owns several Metang.

Mew is incredibly adaptable, able to travel freely in the air or underwater. As seen in Pokemon Snap, it can create a pink orb of energy around itself for protection.Reports found in Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion note scientific expeditions that have sighted Mew in Guyana, South America, the place where it was first discovered. Since Mew can make itself invisible at will, very few people have knowingly seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be a mirage. It will only show itself to a person who is pure of heart.In this movie, Mew made a couple of cameo appearances at the start of the movie. A Mewtwo was cloned from Mew's DNA, extracted from Mew's eyelash. Later, Mew started appearing around New Island while Mewtwo was testing his starter Pokemon clones. Mew followed Team Rocket into the main part of the island so it could stop Mewtwo from destroying the world. After the end credits of the movie, Mew is shown flying to the mountains.In the Japanese version, Mew's characterization was different.

They catch up to Green and her unwilling ally Red soon afterward, and interrupt them when they tracked down and attempted to capture the rare Pokemon. However, when their Jynx was able to almost succeed, Mew's powerful Psychic attack left them listless, and soon escaped. The small samples of its DNA that the Rockets acquired, however, led to the creation of its powerful clone.When Blaine was explaining about Mewtwo's origin to Red, in And Mewtwo Too?!

398 Mewtwo (Japanese:  Mewtwo) is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokemon.While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon, it can Mega Evolve into two different forms: Mega Mewtwo X using Mewtwonite X and Mega Mewtwo Y using Mewtwonite Y.It is a member of the Mew duo along with Mew.Mewtwo is a Pokemon created by science. It is a bipedal, humanoid creature with some feline features. It is primarily gray with a long, purple tail. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base, but thins before ending in a small bulb.Mega Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer, extending from V-shaped ridges on its forehead, pointed, and curved upward. It retains the tube behind its neck, but its eyes are now light blue, and it has large, purple growths over its shoulders. Its torso is smooth and small compared to its long, bulky limbs, and a Y-shaped line connects the collar and underbelly. Its forearms and thighs each have two raised ridges, and its digits are now longer and thinner. The tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip.In comparison, Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail. On its head it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting the base of each, with empty space inside. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous, and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a sternum replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two.Mewtwo was created after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments based on Mew. It is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokemon, lack compassion, and strike fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. In the first movie, Mewtwo exemplified these vicious characteristics and was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy, and mind control. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another Mewtwo in the anime shared its aversion to contact with others, but was much less belligerent. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless to unleash its full power in battle. It is also capable of materializing psychic waves in the form of its signature move, Psystrike. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in a dark cave somewhere.According to the scientific logs found in the Pokemon Mansion of Cinnabar Island, Mewtwo was born of a pregnant Mew, found deep in the jungles of Guyana, whose embryo had been tampered with to alter its DNA. It was held and studied in the mansion where a scientist performed horrific gene-splicing experiments that made it vicious and extremely powerful. It eventually broke free of the Mansion, destroying it in the process, and fled. It can be encountered in Cerulean Cave, accessible only after a Trainer has proven his or her skill at the Indigo Plateau.While Mewtwo has been the Pokemon of focus of a movie and a special, it also made brief appearances in The Battle of the Badge and Showdown at the Po-ke Corral in its body armor.

While a scene involving Mewtwo and Giovanni did appear in It's Mr. Mime Time, it wasn't in the movie. Mewtwo made further appearances during the openings of Jirachi Wish Maker standing on a rooftop wearing a cape, and in the intro of Destiny Deoxys and The Rise of Darkrai, chasing a Mew.Another Mewtwo and the Mega Evolution Mega Mewtwo Y debuted in the special episode Mewtwo  Prologue to Awakening, a prologue to Genesect and the Legend Awakened. In the special, Mewtwo escaped from its creators and fought against a Pokemon hunter named Dirk, while Virgil helped protect it.It reappeared in Genesect and the Legend Awakened as both its normal form and Mega Mewtwo Y. At the beginning of the film, Mewtwo encountered the Genesect Army, who were looking for their home after being recreated. After a short conflict, the Army departed, and Mewtwo followed them to New Tork City. It met Ash and his friends, then got into a great conflict with the Red Genesect leading the Army.A mirage Mewtwo appears in The Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon and is the most powerful Pokemon controlled by the Mirage Master.Mewtwo appears as the ultimate adversary of Red in Pokemon Origins in File 4 - Charizard.
